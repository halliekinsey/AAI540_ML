# General Instructions

# Purpose of Form

Form 1065 is an information return used to report the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits, and other information from the operation of a partnership. Generally, a partnership doesn't pay tax on its income but passes through any profits or losses to its partners. Partners must include partnership items on their tax or information returns.

# Definitions

Centralized Partnership Audit Regime. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA) created a new centralized partnership audit regime effective for partnership tax years beginning after 2017. The new audit regime replaces the consolidated audit proceedings under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA). The new audit regime applies to all partnerships unless the partnership is an eligible partnership and elects out by making a valid election using Schedule B-2 (Form 1065).

# Electing out of the centralized partnership audit regime.

See Electing Out of the Centralized Partnership Audit Regime, later.

# Adjustment year.

An adjustment year is a tax year in which:

- In the case of an adjustment pursuant to the decision of a court in a proceeding brought under section 6234, such decision becomes final;
---
• In the case of an administrative adjustment request (AAR) under section 6227, such AAR is filed; or

• In any other case, a notice of final partnership adjustment is mailed under section 6231 or, if the partnership waives the restrictions under section 6232(b) (regarding limitations on assessments), the waiver is executed by the IRS.

# Reviewed year

A reviewed year is a partnership’s tax year to which a partnership adjustment relates.

# Partnership

A partnership is the relationship between two or more persons who join to carry on a trade or business, with each person contributing money, property, labor, or skill and each expecting to share in the profits and losses of the business whether or not a formal partnership agreement is made.

The term “partnership” includes a limited partnership, syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization, through or by which any business, financial operation, or venture is carried on, that isn't, within the meaning of regulations under section 7701, a corporation, trust, estate, or sole proprietorship.

A joint undertaking merely to share expenses isn't a partnership. Mere co-ownership of property that is maintained and leased or rented isn't a partnership. However, if the co-owners provide services to the tenants, a partnership exists.

# General Partner

A general partner is a partner who is personally liable for partnership debts.

# General Partnership

A general partnership is composed only of general partners.

# Exception—qualified joint venture (QJV)

If you and your spouse materially participate as the only members of a jointly owned and operated business, and you file a joint return for the tax year, you can make an election to be treated as a QJV instead of a partnership. By making the election, you won't be required to file Form 1065 for any year the election is in effect and will instead report the income and deductions directly on your joint return.

A QJV conducts a trade or business where the only members of the joint venture are a married couple who file a joint return, both spouses materially participate in the trade or business (because mere joint ownership of property isn’t enough), both spouses elect not to be treated as a partnership, and the business is co-owned by both spouses and isn't held in the name of a state law entity such as a partnership or limited liability company (LLC).

To make this election, you must divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit between you and your spouse in accordance with your respective interests in the venture. Each of you must file a separate Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business; or Schedule F (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Farming. On each line of your separate Schedule C or F (Form 1040), you must enter your share of the applicable income, deduction, or loss. Each of you must also file a separate Schedule SE (Form 1040), Self-Employment Tax, to pay self-employment tax, as applicable.

# Limited Partner

A limited partner is a partner in a partnership formed under a state limited partnership law, whose personal liability for partnership debts is limited to the amount of money or other property that the partner contributed or is required to contribute to the partnership. Some members of other entities, such as domestic or foreign business trusts or LLCs that are classified as partnerships, may be treated as limited partners for certain purposes.

However, whether a partner qualifies as a limited partner for purposes of self-employment tax depends on whether the partner is considered a limited partner under section 1402(a) (13). See Self-Employment, later.

# Limited Partnership

A limited partnership is formed under a state limited partnership law and composed of at least one general partner and one or more limited partners.

# Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)

An LLP is formed under a state limited liability partnership law. Generally, a partner in an LLP isn't personally liable for the debts of the LLP or any other partner, nor is a partner liable for the acts or omissions of any other partner solely by reason of being a partner.

# Limited Liability Company (LLC)

An LLC is an entity formed under state law by filing articles of organization as an LLC. Unlike a partnership, none of the members of an LLC are personally liable for its debts. An LLC may be classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership, a corporation, or an entity disregarded as an entity separate from its owner by applying the rules in Regulations section 301.7701-3. See Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, for more details.

# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

3
---
# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

A domestic LLC with at least two members that doesn't file Form 8832 is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

# Nonrecourse Loans

Nonrecourse loans are those liabilities of the partnership for which no partner or related person bears the economic risk of loss.

# Section 721(c) Partnership

A partnership (domestic or foreign) is a section 721(c) partnership if there is a contribution of section 721(c) property to the partnership and, after the contribution (and all transactions related to the contribution), (a) a related foreign person with respect to the U.S. transferor is a direct or indirect partner in the partnership; and (b) the U.S. transferor and related persons own 80% or more of the interests in partnership capital, profits, deductions, or losses. See Regulations section 1.721(c)-1(b)(14).

# U.S. Transferor

A U.S. transferor is a U.S. person other than a domestic partnership. See Regulations section 1.721(c)-1(b)(18).

# Section 721(c) Property

Schedule K, line 6a, and each member's distributive share in box 6a of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). Net operating losses aren't deductible by the members but may be carried back or forward by the organization under the rules of section 172. The religious or apostolic organization must also make its annual information return available for public inspection. For this purpose, an annual information return includes an exact copy of Form 1065 and all accompanying schedules and attached statements, except Schedules K-1. For more details, see Regulations section 301.6104(d)-1.

A qualifying syndicate, pool, joint venture, or similar organization may elect under section 761(a) not to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and won't be required to file Form 1065 except for the year of election. For details, see section 761(a) and Regulations section 1.761-2.

Real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) must file Form 1066, U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC) Income Tax Return.

Certain publicly traded partnerships (PTPs) treated as corporations under section 7704 must file Form 1120.

Note. Notwithstanding the preceding, a partnership that is, or has a branch that is, a qualified derivatives dealer (QDD) must file Form 1065. See Qualified derivatives dealers (QDDs), later.

# Section 721(c) Property

Section 721(c) property is property (other than excluded property) with built-in gain that is contributed to a partnership by a U.S. transferor, including pursuant to a contribution described in Regulations section 1.721(c)-2(d) (partnership look-through rule). See Regulations section 1.721(c)-1(b)(15).

# Gain Deferral Contribution

A gain deferral contribution is a contribution of section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership with respect to which the recognition of gain is deferred under the gain deferral method. See Regulations section 1.721(c)-1(b)(7).

# Gain Deferral Method

The gain deferral method is the method described in Regulations section 1.721(c)-3(b) applied to avoid the immediate recognition of gain on a contribution of section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership under Regulations section 1.721(c)-2(b).

# Who Must File

# Domestic Partnerships

Except as provided below, every domestic partnership must file Form 1065, unless it neither receives income nor incurs any expenditures treated as deductions or credits for federal income tax purposes.

Note. To be certified as a qualified opportunity fund (QOF), the partnership must file Form 1065 and attach Form 8996, Qualified Opportunity Fund, even if the partnership had no income or expenses to report. See Schedule B, question 25, and the Instructions for Form 8996.

Entities formed as LLCs that are classified as partnerships for federal income tax purposes have the same filing requirements as domestic partnerships.

A religious or apostolic organization exempt from income tax under section 501(d) must file Form 1065 to report its taxable income, which must be allocated to its members as a dividend, whether distributed or not. Such an organization must figure its taxable income on an attached statement to Form 1065 in the same manner as a corporation. The organization may use Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return, for this purpose. Enter the organization's taxable income, if any, on Form 1065, its tax year;

# Exceptions

The partnership had U.S. source income of $20,000 or less during its tax year;

Less than 1% of any partnership item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit was allocable in the aggregate to direct U.S. partners at any time during its tax year; and

The partnership isn't a withholding foreign partnership as defined in Regulations section 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i).

# Exception for foreign partnerships with no U.S. partners and no effectively connected income.

A foreign partnership with U.S. source income isn't required to file a return if it meets the following requirements.

The partnership had no effectively connected income during its tax year.

The partnership had no U.S. partners at any time during its tax year.

The partnership isn't a withholding foreign partnership as defined in Regulations section 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i).

All required Forms 1042, Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons, and 1042-S, Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding, were filed by the partnership or another withholding agent as required by Regulations sections 1.1461-1(b) and (c).
---
The tax liability of each partner for amounts reportable under Regulations sections 1.1461-1(b) and (c) has been fully satisfied by the withholding of tax at the source.

A foreign partnership filing Form 1065 solely to make an election (such as an election to amortize organization expenses) need only provide its name, address, and employer identification number (EIN) on page 1 of Form 1065 and attach a statement citing “Regulations section 1.6031(a)-1(b)(5)” and identifying the election being made. A foreign partnership filing Form 1065 solely to make an election must obtain an EIN if it doesn't already have one.

Qualified derivatives dealers (QDDs) A partnership that is, or has a branch that is, a QDD (QDD partnership) must file Form 1065 even if it wouldn't be required to file otherwise. A QDD partnership must attach a statement (QDD statement) to its Form 1065 with certain required information as provided in section 7.01(C) of the qualified intermediary agreement in Rev. Proc. 2022-43, 2022-52 I.R.B. 570. If the only reason the partnership is filing Form 1065 is because it's a QDD partnership, then the only information it must provide on Form 1065 in addition to the QDD statement is its tax year, name, address, and EIN; and it must check item G on page 1 of Form 1065. While a partnership is generally required to use an EIN, if the only reason the partnership is filing Form 1065 is because it's a QDD partnership and it doesn't have an EIN, it may use its QI-EIN instead.

# Termination of the Partnership

A partnership terminates when all its operations are discontinued and no part of any business, financial operation, or venture is continued by any of its partners in a partnership.

The partnership’s tax year ends on the date of termination which is the date the partnership winds up its affairs. Special rules apply in the case of a merger, consolidation, or division of a partnership. See Regulations sections 1.708-1(c) and (d) for details. Also see IRS.gov/newsroom/questions-and-answers-about-technical-terminations-internal-revenue-code-irc-sec-708.

# Electronic Filing

Beginning January 1, 2024, partnerships were required to file Form 1065 and related forms and schedules electronically if they file 10 or more returns of any type during the tax year, including information, income tax, employment tax, and excise tax returns. See Regulations section 301.6011-3, updated by T.D. 9972.

Partnerships with more than 100 partners are required to file Form 1065, Schedules K-1, and other related forms and schedules electronically.

# Who Must Sign

Any Partner or LLC Member

Form 1065 isn't considered to be a return unless it's signed by a partner or LLC member. When a return is made for a partnership by a receiver, trustee, or assignee, the fiduciary must sign the return, instead of the partner or LLC member. Returns and forms signed by a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of a partnership must be accompanied by a copy of the order or instructions of the court authorizing signing of the return or form. In the case of an entity partner, an individual who is authorized under state law to act for the entity partner must sign the partnership return.

# Extension of Time To File

File Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns, to request an extension of time to file. File Form 7004 by the regular due date of the partnership return. Form 7004 can be electronically filed. See the Instructions for Form 7004.

# Period Covered

The 2024 Form 1065 is an information return for calendar year 2024 and fiscal years that begin in 2024 and end in 2025. For a fiscal year or a short tax year, fill in the tax year space at the top of Form 1065 and each Schedule K-1 and Schedules K-2 and K-3, if applicable.

The 2024 Form 1065 may also be used if:

- The partnership has a tax year of less than 12 months that begins and ends in 2025, and
- The 2025 Form 1065 isn't available by the time the partnership is required to file its return.

However, the partnership must show its 2025 tax year on the 2024 Form 1065 and incorporate any tax law changes that are effective for tax years beginning after 2024.

# Paid Preparer’s Information

If a partner, member, or employee of the partnership completes Form 1065, the paid preparer's space should remain blank. Only paid preparers with a valid preparer tax identification number (PTIN) should complete this section.

Generally, anyone who is paid to prepare the partnership return must do the following:

- Sign the return in the space provided for the preparer's signature.
- Fill in the other blanks in the “Paid Preparer Use Only” area of the return. A paid preparer can't use a social security number (SSN) in the “Paid Preparer Use Only” box. The paid preparer must use a PTIN.
- Give the partnership a copy of the return in addition to the copy to be filed with the IRS.
---
A paid preparer may sign original or amended returns by rubber stamp, mechanical device, or computer software program.

# Paid Preparer Authorization

If the partnership wants to allow the paid preparer to discuss its 2024 Form 1065 with the IRS, check “Yes” in the signature area of the return. The authorization applies only to the individual whose signature appears in the “Paid Preparer Use Only” section of its return. It doesn't apply to the firm, if any, shown in the section.

If “Yes” is checked, the partnership is authorizing the IRS to call the paid preparer to answer any questions that may arise during the processing of its return. The partnership is also authorizing the paid preparer to:

- Give the IRS any information that is missing from its return,
- Call the IRS for information about the processing of its return, and
- Respond to certain IRS notices about math errors and return preparation.

The partnership isn't authorizing the paid preparer to bind the partnership to anything or otherwise represent the partnership before the IRS. If the partnership wants to expand the paid preparer's authorization, see Pub. 947, Practice Before the IRS and Power of Attorney.

The authorization can't be revoked. However, the authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (excluding extensions) for filing the 2025 return.

# Penalties

# Late Filing of Return

A penalty is assessed against the partnership if it's required to file a partnership return and it (a) fails to file the return by the due date, including extensions; or (b) files a return that fails to show all the information required, unless such failure is due to reasonable cause. The penalty is $245 for each month or part of a month (for a maximum of 12 months) the failure continues, multiplied by the total number of persons who were partners in the partnership during any part of the partnership's tax year for which the return is due. If the partnership receives a notice about a penalty after it files the return, the partnership may send the IRS an explanation and the IRS will determine if the explanation meets reasonable-cause criteria. Don’t attach an explanation when filing the return.

# Failure To Furnish Information Timely

For each failure to furnish Schedule K-1 (and K-3, if applicable) to a partner when due and each failure to include on Schedule K-1 (and K-3, if applicable) all the information required to be shown (or the inclusion of incorrect information), a $330 penalty may be imposed for each Schedule K-1 (and K-3, if applicable) for which a failure occurs. For all such failures during a calendar year, the maximum penalty for entities with gross receipts over $5,000,000 is $3,987,000; and $1,329,000 for entities with gross receipts at or below $5,000,000. If the requirement to report correct information is intentionally disregarded, each $330 penalty is increased to $660 or, if greater, 10% of the aggregate amount of items required to be reported. There's no limit to the amount of the penalty in the case of intentional disregard.

# Trust Fund Recovery Penalty

This penalty may apply if certain excise, income, social security, and Medicare taxes that must be collected or withheld aren't collected or withheld, or these taxes aren't paid. These taxes are generally reported on:

- Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return;
- Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return;
- Form 943, Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees;
- Form 944, Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return; and
- Form 945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax.

The trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by the IRS to have been responsible for collecting, accounting for, or paying over these taxes, and who acted willfully in not doing so. The penalty is equal to the unpaid trust fund tax. See the Instructions for Form 720; Pub. 15 (Circular E), Employer's Tax Guide; or Pub. 15-T, Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods, for more details, including the definition of a responsible person.

# Accounting Methods

An accounting method is a set of rules used to determine when and how income and expenditures are reported. The method of accounting used must be reconcilable with the partnership's books and records. In all cases, the method used must clearly reflect income. Generally, the following rules apply. For more information, see Pub. 538, Accounting Periods and Methods.

Permissible overall methods of accounting include:

- Cash,
- Accrual, or
- Any other method authorized by the Internal Revenue Code (the Code).

Generally, a partnership may use the cash method of accounting unless it’s required to maintain inventories, has a C corporation as a partner, or is a tax shelter (as defined in section 448(d)(3)). However, for tax years beginning after 2017, any partnership qualifying as a small business taxpayer (defined below) may use the cash method.

Tax shelter election. A taxpayer that is a tax shelter, as defined in section 448(d)(3), isn't permitted to use the cash method pursuant to section 448(a)(3), and is also not permitted to use the small business taxpayer exemptions contained in sections 163(j)(3) (limitation on business interest), 263A(i) (uniform capitalization), 460(e)(1)(B) (percentage of completion method), and 471(c) (general inventory method). Under section 448(d)(3), a taxpayer that is a syndicate is considered a tax shelter. For purposes of section 448(d)(3), a syndicate is a partnership or other entity (other than a C corporation) if more than 35% of the losses of such entity during the tax year are allocated to limited partners or limited entrepreneurs.

The final regulations under section 448 permit a taxpayer to make an annual election to use its allocations made in the immediately preceding tax year, instead of using the current tax year's allocation, to determine whether the taxpayer is a syndicate under section 448(d)(3) for the current tax year. The election is made on the timely filed original return (including extensions) for the tax year for which it's made. The election is valid only for the tax year for which it's made and, once made, can't be revoked. See Regulations section 1.448-2(b)(2)(iii)(B)(2) for guidance on the time and manner of making the annual election and effective dates.

Small business taxpayer. For tax years beginning after 2017, a small business taxpayer (defined below) can adopt or change its accounting method to account for inventories (a) in the same manner as materials and supplies that are nonincidental; or (b) to conform to the taxpayer's treatment of inventories in an applicable financial statement (as defined in section 451(b)(3)), or, if the taxpayer doesn't have an applicable financial statement, the method of accounting used in the taxpayer's books and records prepared in accordance with the taxpayer's accounting procedures. See section 471(c)(1), and Change in accounting method, later.

Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)
---
For tax years beginning after 2017, a small business taxpayer can adopt or change its accounting method to not capitalize costs to property produced or acquired for resale under section 263A. See section 263A(i), and Change in accounting method and Limitations on Deductions, later.

# Small business taxpayer defined

For 2024, a small business taxpayer is a taxpayer that (a) has average annual gross receipts of $30 million or less for the prior 3 tax years, and (b) isn't a tax shelter (as defined in section 448(d)(3)).

# Accrual method

Generally, under the accrual method, an amount is includible in income when:

1. All the events have occurred that fix the right to receive income, which is the earliest date:
1. Payment is earned through the required performance,
2. Payment is due to the taxpayer,
3. Payment is received by the taxpayer,
4. When title passes, or
5. When the income is reported as revenue in an applicable financial statement (AFS); and
2. When the amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy.

See Regulations sections 1.451-1(a) and 1.451-3(c) for details.

Generally, an accrual basis taxpayer can deduct accrued expenses in the tax year in which:

- All events that establish the liability have occurred,
- The amount of the liability can be figured with reasonable accuracy, and
- Economic performance takes place with respect to the expense.

For property and service liabilities, for example, economic performance occurs as the property or service is provided. There are special economic performance rules for certain items, including recurring expenses. See section 461(h) and the related regulations for the rules for determining when economic performance takes place.

# Nonaccrual-experience method

Accrual method partnerships aren't required to accrue certain amounts to be received from the performance of services that, on the basis of their experience, won't be collected if:

- The services are in the field of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting; or
- The partnership's average annual gross receipts don’t exceed $30 million for all prior tax years. For more details, see section 448(d)(5).

This provision doesn't apply to any amount if interest is required to be paid on the amount or if there's any penalty for failure to timely pay the amount. For information, see section 448(d)(5) and Regulations section 1.448-2. For reporting requirements, see the instructions for line 1a, later.

# Percentage of completion method

Long-term contracts (except for certain real property construction contracts) must generally be accounted for using the percentage of completion method described in section 460. See section 460 and the underlying regulations for rules on long-term contracts.

# Mark-to-market accounting method

Dealers in securities must use the mark-to-market accounting method described in section 475. Under this method, any security that is inventory to the dealer must be included in inventory at its fair market value (FMV). Any security that isn't inventory and that is held at the close of the tax year is treated as sold at its FMV on the last business day of the tax year, and any gain or loss must be taken into account in determining gross income. The gain or loss taken into account is generally treated as ordinary gain or loss. For details, including exceptions, see section 475, the related regulations, and Rev. Rul. 97-39, 1997-39 I.R.B. 4.

Dealers in commodities and traders in securities and commodities can elect to use the mark-to-market accounting method. To make the election, the partnership must file a statement describing the election, the first tax year the election is to be effective, and, in the case of an election for traders in securities or commodities, the trade or business for which the election is made. Except for new taxpayers, the statement must be filed by the due date (not including extensions) of the return for the tax year immediately preceding the election year and attached to that return or, if applicable, to a request for an extension of time to file that return. For more details, see Rev. Proc. 99-17, 1999-7 I.R.B. 52, as superseded in part by Rev. Proc. 99-49; and sections 475(e) and (f).

# Change in accounting method

Generally, the partnership must get IRS consent to change its method of accounting used to report income or expense (for income or expense as a whole or for any material item). To do so, the partnership must generally file Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, during the tax year for which the change is requested. See the Instructions for Form 3115 and Pub. 538 for more information and exceptions.

# Section 481(a) adjustment

The partnership may have to make an adjustment to prevent amounts of income or expenses from being omitted or duplicated. This is called a section 481(a) adjustment. The section 481(a) adjustment period is generally 1 year for a net negative adjustment and 4 years for a net positive adjustment. However, in some instances, a partnership can elect to modify the section 481(a) adjustment period. The partnership must complete the appropriate lines of Form 3115 to make the election. See the Instructions for Form 3115.

Include any net positive section 481(a) adjustment on page 1 of Form 1065, line 7. If the net section 481(a) adjustment is negative, report it on page 1, line 21.

There are some instances when the partnership can obtain automatic consent from the IRS to change to certain accounting methods. See the Instructions for Form 3115.

# Accounting Periods

A partnership is generally required to have one of the following tax years.

1. The tax year of a majority of its partners (majority tax year).
2. If there's no majority tax year, then the tax year common to all of the partnership's principal partners (partners with an interest of 5% or more in the partnership profits or capital).
3. If there's neither a majority tax year nor a tax year common to all principal partners, then the tax year that results in the least aggregate deferral of income.

Note. In determining the tax year of a partnership under (1), (2), or (3) above, the tax years of certain tax-exempt and foreign partners are disregarded. See Regulations section 1.706-1(b) for more details.

4. Some other tax year if one of the following applies.

- The partnership can establish that there's a business purpose for the tax year.
- The partnership elects under section 444 to have a tax year other than a required tax year by filing Form 8716, Election To Have a Tax Year Other Than a Required Tax Year. For a partnership to have this election in effect, it must make the payments required by section 7519 and file Form 8752, Required Payment or Refund Under Section 7519.

A section 444 election ends if a partnership changes its accounting period to its required tax year or some other.

The partnership elects to use a 52–53-week tax year that ends with reference to either its required tax year or a tax year elected under section 444.

# Change of tax year

To change its tax year or to adopt or retain a tax year other than its required tax year, the partnership must file Form 1128, Application To Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year, unless the partnership is making an election under section 444.

TIP The tax year of a common trust fund must be the calendar year.

have its partners take adjustments into account, and that has adjustments that result in an imputed underpayment (IU), should report the IU and any interest and penalties on Form 1065, page 1, line 26. See the Instructions for Form 8082 for information on how to figure a BBA IU and what to do when an adjustment requested by an AAR doesn't result in an IU.

- Name of partnership.
- Form 1065.
- Taxpayer identification number (TIN).
- Tax year.
- BBA AAR Imputed Underpayment.
- Checks must be made payable to “United States Treasury.”

Mail payment to:

Ogden Service Center
Ogden, UT 84201-0011

# Rounding Off to Whole Dollars

The partnership may enter decimal points and cents when completing its return. However, it should round off cents to whole dollars on its return, forms, and schedules to make completing its return easier. The partnership must either round off all amounts on the return to whole dollars, or use cents for all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $8.40 rounds to $8 and $8.50 rounds to $9.

If two or more amounts are added to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total.

# Recordkeeping

The partnership must keep its records as long as they may be needed for the administration of any provision of the Code. The partnership must usually keep records that support an item of income, deduction, or credit on the partnership return for 3 years from the date the return is due or is filed, whichever is later. These records must usually be kept for 3 years from the date each partner's return is due or is filed, whichever is later. It must also keep records that verify the partnership's basis in property for as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or replacement property.

The partnership should also keep copies of all returns it has filed. They help in preparing future returns and in making computations when filing an amended return.

# Administrative Adjustment Request (AAR)

A partnership that is subject to the BBA centralized partnership audit regime must file an AAR to request an administrative adjustment in the amount or other treatment of one or more partnership-related items.

A BBA partnership filing an AAR shouldn't file an amended tax return or amended Schedules K-1 and/or K-3. For an exception where a BBA partnership is itself a partner in a BBA partnership and is filing an amended return, see Partner amended return filed as part of modification of the IU during a BBA examination, later.

# Electronically filed AARs

If the AAR will be filed electronically, complete Form 1065 with the corrected amounts and check box G(5). In addition, complete Form 8082, Notice of Inconsistent Treatment or Administrative Adjustment Request (AAR). See the Instructions for Form 8082 for detailed instructions. For AARs filed on paper, see Paper-filed amended returns and AARs, later.

# AARs for which payment is made

A partnership that hasn't made a valid election out of the BBA centralized partnership audit regime, which is filing an AAR and that doesn't elect to have its partners take the adjustments into account instead of paying the IU. See the Instructions for Form 8082 for information on how to make the election.

# Amended Return

The procedures to follow when filing an amended partnership return depend on whether the amended return is filed electronically or on paper. The rules for determining when a return must be filed electronically (see Electronic Filing, earlier) also apply to amended returns.

# Electronically filed amended returns

If the amended return will be filed electronically, complete Form 1065 and check box G(5) to indicate that you're filing an amended return. Attach a statement that identifies the line number of each amended item, the corrected amount or other treatment of the item, and an explanation of the reason(s) for each change. If the income, deductions, credits, or other information provided to any partner on Schedule K-1 or K-3, as applicable, is incorrect, file an amended Schedule K-1 or K-3 for that partner with the amended Form 1065. Also give a copy of the amended Schedule K-1 or K-3 to that partner. Check the “Amended K-1” or “Amended K-3” box at the top of the Schedule K-1 or K-3 to indicate that it's an amended Schedule K-1 or K-3.

# Partner amended return filed as part of modification of the IU during a BBA examination

Section 6225(c)(2) allows a BBA partnership under examination to request specific types of modifications of any IU proposed by the IRS. One type of modification that may be requested is when one or more partners, including partnership-partners, file amended returns for the tax years of the partners which include the end of the reviewed year of the BBA partnership under examination and for any tax year with respect to which tax attributes are affected. Go to IRS.gov/bbaaar.

A modification amended return filing must meet a number of requirements. Therefore, a partnership-partner filing a modification amended return must refer to Form 8982, Affidavit for Partner Modification Amended Return Under IRC 6225(c)(2)(A) or Partner Alternative Procedure Under IRC 6225(c)(2)(B). The instructions for Form 8982, Section A, explain the modification of amended returns, requirements for payment and submission, and the requirement to provide Form 8982, Section A, to the PR of the BBA partnership. See Filing Instructions for Partner Modification Amended Returns and Paying the Amount You Owe in the instructions for Form 8982.

# Partnership-partners who are filing amended returns

When a partnership's federal return is amended or electronically as part of the modification will report the applicable changed for any reason, it may affect the partnership's state tax return. For more information, contact the state tax agency for the state in which the partnership return was filed.

# What if You Can’t Pay Now?

Go to IRS.gov/Payments for more information about your options.

- Apply for an online payment agreement (IRS.gov/OPA) to meet your tax obligation in monthly installments if you can’t pay your taxes in full today. Once you complete the online process, you will receive immediate notification of whether your agreement has been approved.
- Use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier (IRS.gov/OIC) to see if you can settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe.

# Entity Classification Election

Use Form 8832 to make a change in classification. Except for certain business entities always classified as corporations, a business entity with at least two members may choose to be classified either as a partnership or an association taxable as a corporation. A domestic eligible entity with at least two members that doesn't file Form 8832 is classified under the default rules as a partnership. However, a foreign eligible entity with at least two members is classified under the default rules as a partnership only if the entity doesn't provide limited liability to at least one.
---
member. File Form 8832 only if the entity doesn't want to be classified under these default rules or if it wants to change its classification. Attach a copy of Form 8832 to the partnership's Form 1065 for the tax year of the election.

# CAUTION

# Elections Made by the Partnership

Generally, the partnership decides how to figure income from its operations. For example, it chooses the accounting method and depreciation methods it will use. The partnership also makes elections under the following sections.

1. Section 179 (election to expense certain property).
2. Section 614 (definition of property—mines, wells, and other natural deposits). This election must be made before the partners figure their individual depletion allowances under section 613A(c)(7)(D).
3. Section 1033 (involuntary conversions).
4. Section 754 (manner of electing optional adjustment to basis of partnership property).

Under section 754, a partnership may elect to adjust the basis of partnership property when property is distributed or when a partnership interest is transferred. If the election is made regarding a transfer of a partnership interest (section 743(b)) and the assets of the partnership constitute a trade or business for purposes of section 1060(c), then the value of any goodwill transferred must be determined in the manner provided in Regulations section 1.1060-1. Once an election is made under section 754, it applies both to all distributions and to all transfers made during the tax year and in all subsequent tax years unless the election is revoked.

This election must be made in a statement that is filed with the partnership's timely filed return (including any extension) for the tax year during which the distribution or transfer occurs. See Regulations section 1.754-1(b)(1). The statement must include:

- a. The name and EIN of the partnership making the election;
- b. A declaration that the partnership elects under Regulations section 1.1411-10(g) to apply the rules in Regulations section 1.1411-10(g) to the CFCs and QEFs identified in the statement; and
- c. The following information for each CFC and QEF for which an election is made: (a) the name of the CFC or QEF; and (b) either the EIN of the CFC or QEF, or, if an EIN isn’t available, the reference ID number of the CFC or QEF.

Section 743(e) (electing investment partnership).
Regulations section 1.1411-10(g) (section 1411 election regarding controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) and qualified electing fund (QEF)).

A domestic partnership that directly or indirectly owns stock of a CFC (within the meaning of section 953(c)(1)(B) or section 957(a)) or a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) (within the meaning of section 1297(a)) that the domestic partnership treats as a QEF under section 1293 may make the election provided in Regulations section 1.1411-10(g). The election must be made no later than the first tax year beginning after 2013 during which the partnership:

- • Section 59(e) (election to deduct ratably certain qualified expenditures such as intangible drilling costs, mining exploration expenses, or research and experimental (R&E) expenditures).
- • Section 108 (income from discharge of indebtedness).
- • Section 617 (deduction and recapture of certain mining exploration expenditures paid or incurred).

# Partnership Items

If the basis of partnership property has been adjusted for a transferee partner under section 743(b), the partnership must adjust the transferee's distributive share of the items of partnership income, deduction, gain, or loss in accordance with Regulations sections 1.743-1(j)(3) and (4). These adjustments (other than adjustments to depletable oil and gas property allocable to the partner under section 613A(c)(7)(D)) must be reported on Schedule K and the transferee partner's Schedule K-1. Report the adjustments on an attached statement to Schedule K, line 20c, code U. See the instructions for Schedule K, line 20. Identify the partnership item being adjusted and the amount of the adjustment. If the adjustments are to partnership items from more than one trade or business, report the adjustments separately for each activity.

To revoke a section 754 election, the partnership must file the revocation request using Form 15254, Request for Section 754 Revocation. See the instructions for Form 15254 for more information.

# Electing Out of the Centralized Partnership Audit Regime

A partnership can elect out of the centralized partnership audit regime for a tax year if the partnership is an eligible partnership that year. See Question 33 under Schedule B, later.

# Elections Made by Each Partner

Elections under the following sections are made by each partner separately on the partner's tax return.
---
# Section 901 (foreign tax credit)

# Partner’s Dealings With Partnership

If a partner engages in a transaction with the partnership, other than in the capacity as a partner, the partner is treated as not being a member of the partnership for that transaction. Special rules apply to sales or exchanges of property between partnerships and certain persons, as explained in Pub. 541.

# Contributions to the Partnership

Generally, no gain (loss) is recognized to the partnership or any of the partners when property is contributed to the partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership. This rule doesn't apply to any gain realized on a transfer of property to a partnership that would be treated as an investment company (within the meaning of section 351(e)) if the partnership were incorporated. If, as a result of a transfer of property to a partnership, there's a direct or indirect transfer of money or other property to the transferring partner, the partner may have to recognize gain on the exchange.

The basis to the partnership of property contributed by a partner is the adjusted basis in the hands of the partner at the time it was contributed, plus any gain recognized (under section 721(b)) by the partner at that time. See section 723 for more information.

See Regulations sections 1.721(c)-1(b)(7) and 1.721(c)-3(b) for more information on a gain deferral contribution of section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership. Also see Section 721(c) Partnership, Section 721(c) Property, and Gain Deferral Method under Definitions, earlier.

# Dispositions of Contributed Property

Generally, if the partnership disposes of property contributed to the partnership by a partner, income, gain, loss, and deductions from that property must be allocated among the partners to take into account the difference between the property's basis and its FMV at the time of the contribution. However, if the adjusted basis of the contributed property exceeds its FMV at the time of the contribution, the built-in loss can only be taken into account by the contributing partner. For all other partners, the basis of the property in the hands of the partnership is treated as equal to its FMV at the time of the contribution (see section 704(c)(1)(C)).

For property contributed to the partnership, the contributing partner must recognize gain or loss on a distribution of the property to another partner within 7 years of being contributed. The gain or loss is equal to the amount that the contributing partner should have recognized if the property had been sold for its FMV when distributed, because of the difference between the property's basis and its FMV at the time of contribution.

See section 704(c) for details and other rules on dispositions of contributed property. See section 724 for the character of any gain or loss recognized on the disposition of unrealized receivables, inventory items, or capital loss property contributed to the partnership by a partner.

See Regulations sections 1.721(c)-4 and 1.721(c)-5 for more information on certain dispositions of contributed 721(c) property to which the gain deferral method applies. Also see Section 721(c) Partnership, Section 721(c) Property, and Gain Deferral Method under Definitions, earlier.

# Recognition of Precontribution Gain on Certain Partnership Distributions

A partner who contributes appreciated property to the partnership must include in income any precontribution gain to the extent the FMV of other property (other than money) distributed to the partner by the partnership exceeds the adjusted basis of the partner’s partnership interest just before the distribution. Precontribution gain is the net gain, if any, that would have been recognized under section 704(c)(1)(B) if the partnership had distributed to another partner all the property that had been contributed to the partnership by the distributee partner within 7 years of the distribution and that was held by the partnership just before the distribution.

Appropriate basis adjustments are to be made to the adjusted basis of the distributee partner's interest in the partnership and the partnership's basis in the contributed property to reflect the gain recognized by the partner.

For more details and exceptions, see Pub. 541.

# Unrealized Receivables and Inventory Items

Generally, if a partner sells or exchanges a partnership interest where unrealized receivables or inventory items are involved, the transferor partner must notify the partnership, in writing, within 30 days of the exchange. The partnership must then file Form 8308, Report of a Sale or Exchange of Certain Partnership Interests.

If a partnership distributes unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items in exchange for all or part of a partner's interest in other partnership property (including money), treat the transaction as a sale or exchange between the partner and the partnership. Treat the partnership gain (loss) as ordinary business income (loss). The income (loss) is specially allocated only to partners other than the distributee partner.

If a partnership gives other property (including money) for all or part of that partner's interest in the partnership's unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items, treat the transaction as a sale or exchange of the property.

See Rev. Rul. 84-102, 1984-2 C.B. 119, for information on the tax consequences that result when a new partner joins a partnership that has liabilities and unrealized receivables. Also see Pub. 541 for more information on unrealized receivables and inventory items.

# At-Risk Limitations

In general, section 465 limits the amount of deductible losses partners can claim from certain activities. The at-risk limitations don't apply to the partnership, but instead apply to each partner's share of net losses attributable to each activity. Because the treatment of each partner's share of partnership losses depends on the nature of the activity that generated it, the partnership must report the items of income, loss, and deduction separately for each activity. The at-risk limitation applies to individuals, estates, trusts, and certain closely held C corporations. See Pub. 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules, for additional information.

Activities covered by the at-risk rules. If the partnership is involved in one of the following activities as a trade or business or for the production of income, the partner may be subject to the at-risk rules.

1. Holding, producing, or distributing motion picture films or videotapes.
2. Farming.
3. Leasing section 1245 property, including personal property and certain other tangible property that's depreciable or amortizable.
4. Exploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas.
5. Exploring for, or exploiting, geothermal deposits (for wells started after September 1978).
---
# 6. Any other activity not included in items 1 through 5, above, that's carried on as a trade or business or for the production of income.

To allow each partner to correctly apply the passive activity limitations, the partnership must report income or loss and credits separately by activity for each of the following:

- Trade or business activities.
- Rental real estate activities.
- Rental activities other than real estate.
- Portfolio income.

# Aggregation of activities.

Activities described in item 6 above that constitute a trade or business are treated as one activity if:

- You actively participate in the management of the trade or business, or
- The trade or business is carried on by a partnership or S corporation and 65% or more of its losses for the tax year are allocable to persons who actively participate in the management of the trade or business.

Similar rules apply to activities described in items 1 through 5 above. For more information, see Pub. 925.

# At-risk activity reporting requirements.

If the partnership items of income, loss, or deduction reported on Schedule K-1 are from more than one activity covered by the at-risk rules, the partnership should report on an attachment to Schedule K-1 information relating to each activity as is required by Item K1. Partner's Share of Liabilities, later. See the Instructions for Form 6198 and Pub. 925 for additional information needed to help the partner compute the profit or loss from each at-risk activity and the amount at risk that may be required to be separately reported.

# Passive Activity Limitations

In general, section 469 limits the amount of losses, deductions, and credits that partners can claim from passive activities. The passive activity limitations don't apply to the partnership. Instead, they apply to each partner's share of any income or loss and credit attributable to a passive activity. Because the treatment of each partner's share of partnership income or loss and credit depends on the nature of the activity that generated it, the partnership must report income or loss and credits separately for each activity.

The following instructions and the instructions for Schedules K and K-1, later, explain the applicable passive activity limitation rules and specify the type of information the partnership must provide to its partners for each activity. If the partnership had more than one activity, it must report information for each activity on an attached statement to Schedules K and K-1.

# Generally, passive activities include

(a) activities that involve the conduct of a trade or business if the partner doesn't materially participate in the activity, and (b) all rental activities (defined later) regardless of the partner's participation. For exceptions, see Activities That Aren’t Passive Activities, later. The level of each partner's participation in an activity must be determined by the partner.

The passive activity rules provide that losses and credits from passive activities can generally be applied only against income and tax from passive activities. Thus, passive losses and credits can't be applied against income from salaries, wages, professional fees, or a business in which the partner materially participates; against portfolio income (defined later); or against the tax related to any of these types of income.

# Special provisions apply to certain activities.

First, the passive activity limitations must be applied separately for a net loss from passive activities held through a PTP. Second, special rules require that net income from certain activities that would otherwise be treated as passive income must be recharacterized as nonpassive income for purposes of the passive activity limitations.

# Trade or Business Activities

A trade or business activity is an activity (other than a rental activity or an activity treated as incidental to an activity of holding property for investment) that:

- Involves the conduct of a trade or business (within the meaning of section 162),
- Is conducted in anticipation of starting a trade or business, or
---
# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

• Involves research or experimental expenditures deductible under section 174 (or that would be if you chose to deduct rather than capitalize them).

If the partner doesn't materially participate in the activity, a trade or business activity conducted through a partnership is generally a passive activity of the partner.

Each partner must determine if the partner materially participated in an activity. As a result, while the partnership's ordinary business income (loss) is reported on page 1 of Form 1065, the specific income and deductions from each separate trade or business activity must be reported on attached statements to Form 1065. Similarly, while each partner's distributive share of the partnership's ordinary business income (loss) is reported in box 1 of Schedule K-1, each partner's distributive share of the income and deductions from each trade or business activity must be reported on attached statements to each Schedule K-1. See Passive Activity Reporting Requirements, later, for more information.

# Rental Activities

Generally, except as noted below, if the gross income from an activity consists of amounts paid principally for the use of real or personal tangible property held by the partnership, the activity is a rental activity.

There are several exceptions to this general rule. Under these exceptions, an activity involving the use of real or personal tangible property isn't a rental activity if any of the following apply.

- The average period of customer use (defined below) for such property is 7 days or less.
- The average period of customer use for such property is 30 days or less and significant personal services (defined below) are provided by or on behalf of the partnership.
- Extraordinary personal services (defined below) are provided by or on behalf of the partnership.
- The rental of such property is treated as incidental to a nonrental activity of the partnership under Temporary Regulations section 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) and Regulations section 1.469-1(e)(3)(vi)(D).
- The partnership customarily makes the property available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers.
- The partnership provides property for use in a nonrental activity of a partnership or joint venture in its capacity as an owner of an interest in such partnership or joint venture. Whether the partnership provides property used in an activity of another partnership or of a joint venture in the partnership's capacity as an owner of an interest in the partnership or joint venture is determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances.

In addition, a guaranteed payment described in section 707(c) is never income from a rental activity.

# Average period of customer use

Figure the average period of customer use for a class of property by dividing the total number of days in all rental periods by the number of rentals during the tax year. If the activity involves renting more than one class of property, multiply the average period of customer use of each class by the ratio of the gross rental income from that class to the activity's total gross rental income. The activity's average period of customer use equals the sum of these class-by-class average periods weighted by gross income. See Regulations section 1.469-1(e)(3)(iii).

# Significant personal services

Personal services include only services performed by individuals. To determine if personal services are significant personal services, consider all the relevant facts and circumstances. Relevant facts and circumstances include:

- How often the services are provided,
- The type and amount of labor required to perform the services, and
- The value of the services in relation to the amount charged for use of the property.

The following services aren't considered in determining whether personal services are significant.

- Services necessary to permit the lawful use of the rental property.
- Services performed in connection with improvements or repairs to the rental property that extend the useful life of the property substantially beyond the average rental period.
- Services provided in connection with the use of any improved real property that are similar to those commonly provided in connection with long-term rentals of high-grade commercial or residential property. Examples include cleaning and maintenance of common areas, routine repairs, trash collection, elevator service, and security at entrances.

# Extraordinary personal services

Services provided in connection with making rental property available for customer use are extraordinary personal services only if the services are performed by individuals and the customers' use of the rental property is incidental to their receipt of the services.

For example, a patient's use of a hospital room is generally incidental to the care received from the hospital's medical staff. Similarly, a student's use of a dormitory room in a boarding school is incidental to the personal services provided by the school's teaching staff.

# Rental activity incidental to a nonrental activity

An activity isn't a rental activity if the rental of the property is incidental to a nonrental activity, such as the activity of holding property for investment, a trade or business activity, or the activity of dealing in property.

Rental of property is incidental to an activity of holding property for investment if both of the following apply.

- The main purpose for holding the property is to realize a gain from the appreciation of the property.
- The gross rental income from such property for the tax year is less than 2% of the smaller of the property's unadjusted basis or its FMV.

Rental of property is incidental to a trade or business activity if all of the following apply.

- The partnership owns an interest in the trade or business at all times during the year.
- The rental property was mainly used in the trade or business activity during the tax year or during at least 2 of the 5 preceding tax years.
- The gross rental income from the property for the tax year is less than 2% of the smaller of the property's unadjusted basis or its FMV.

The sale or exchange of property that is also rented during the tax year (in which the gain or loss is recognized) is treated as incidental to the activity of dealing in property if, at the time of the sale or exchange, the property was held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the partnership's trade or business.

See Temporary Regulations section 1.469-1T(e)(3) and Regulations section 1.469-1(e)(3) for more information on the definition of rental activities for purposes of the passive activity limitations.

# Reporting of rental activities

In reporting the partnership's income or losses and credits from rental activities, the partnership must separately report rental real estate activities and rental activities other than rental real estate activities.

Partners who actively participate in a rental real estate activity may be able to deduct part or all of their rental real estate losses (and the deduction equivalent of rental real estate credits).
---
against income (or tax) from nonpassive activities. The combined amount of rental real estate losses and the deduction equivalent of rental real estate credits from all sources (including rental real estate activities not held through the partnership) that may be claimed is limited to $25,000. This $25,000 amount is generally reduced for high-income partners.

Report rental real estate activity income (loss) on Form 8825 and Schedule K, line 2, and in box 2 of Schedule K-1, rather than on page 1 of Form 1065. Report credits related to rental real estate activities on Schedule K, lines 15c and 15d (box 15, codes E and F, of Schedule K-1), and low-income housing credits on Schedule K, lines 15a and 15b (box 15, codes C and D, of Schedule K-1).

See Line 3. Other Net Rental Income (Loss), later, for reporting other net rental income (loss) other than rental real estate.

# Portfolio Income

each owner in the borrowing entity has the same proportional ownership interest in the lending entity.

The self-charged interest rules don't apply to a partner's interest in a partnership if the partnership makes an election under Regulations section 1.469-7(g) to avoid the application of these rules. To make the election, the partnership must attach to its original or amended partnership return a statement that includes the name, address, and EIN of the partnership and a declaration that the election is being made under Regulations section 1.469-7(g). The election will apply to the tax year in which it was made and all subsequent tax years. Once made, the election may only be revoked with the consent of the IRS.

For more details on the self-charged interest rules, see Regulations section 1.469-7.

# Grouping Activities

Generally, portfolio income includes all gross income, other than income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business, that is attributable to interest; dividends; royalties; income from a real estate investment trust (REIT), a regulated investment company (RIC), a REMIC, a common trust fund, a CFC, a QEF, or a cooperative; income from the disposition of property that produces income of a type defined as portfolio income; and income from the disposition of property held for investment. See Self-Charged Interest, later, for an exception.

Solely for purposes of the preceding paragraph, gross income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business includes (and portfolio income, therefore, doesn't include) the following types of income:

- Interest income on loans and investments made in the ordinary course of a trade or business of lending money.
- Interest on accounts receivable arising from the performance of services or the sale of property in the ordinary course of a trade or business of performing such services or selling such property, but only if credit is customarily offered to customers of the business.
- Income from investments made in the ordinary course of a trade or business of furnishing insurance or annuity contracts or reinsuring risks underwritten by insurance companies.
- Income or gain derived in the ordinary course of an activity of trading or dealing in any property if such activity constitutes a trade or business (unless the dealer held the property for investment at any time before such income or gain is recognized).
- Royalties derived by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business of licensing intangible property.
- Amounts included in the gross income of a patron of a cooperative by reason of any payment or allocation to the patron based on patronage as a result of a trade or business of the patron.
- Other income identified by the IRS as income derived by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business.

See Temporary Regulations section 1.469-2T(c)(3) for more information on portfolio income.

Report portfolio income and related deductions on Schedule K rather than on page 1 of Form 1065.

# Self-Charged Interest

Certain self-charged interest income and deductions may be treated as passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions if the loan proceeds are used in a passive activity. Generally, self-charged interest income and deductions result from loans between the partnership and its partners and also include loans between the partnership and another partnership if the partnership holds an interest as a.

Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)
---
limited partner or as a limited entrepreneur (as defined in section 461(k)(4)) if that other activity engages in holding, producing, or distributing motion picture films or videotapes; farming; leasing section 1245 property; or exploring for or exploiting oil and gas resources or geothermal deposits.

Activities conducted through other partnerships. Once a partnership determines its activities under these rules, the partnership as a partner can use these rules to group those activities with:

- Each other,
- Activities conducted directly by the partnership, or
- Activities conducted through other partnerships.

A partner can't treat as separate activities those activities grouped together by a partnership. If you group your activities under these rules for section 469 purposes, check the appropriate box in item K below the name and address block on page 1 of Form 1065.

# Recharacterization of Passive Income

Under Temporary Regulations section 1.469-2T(f) and Regulations section 1.469-2(f), net passive income from certain passive activities must be treated as nonpassive income. Net passive income is the excess of an activity's passive activity gross income over its passive activity deductions (current year deductions and prior year unallowed losses).

Any net passive income recharacterized as nonpassive income is treated as investment income for purposes of figuring investment interest expense limitations if it's from (a) an activity of renting substantially nondepreciable property from an equity-financed lending activity, or (b) an activity related to an interest in a pass-through entity that licenses intangible property.

The amount of income from the activities in the first three paragraphs, below, that any partner will be required to recharacterize as nonpassive income may be limited under Temporary Regulations section 1.469-2T(f)(8). Because the partnership won't have information regarding all of a partner's activities, it must identify all partnership activities meeting the definitions under Certain nondepreciable rental property activities and Passive equity-financed lending activities below as activities that may be subject to recharacterization.

# Income from the following six sources is subject to recharacterization.

# Significant participation passive activities.

A significant participation passive activity is any trade or business activity in which the partner participated for more than 100 hours during the tax year but didn't materially participate. Because each partner must determine the partner's level of participation, the partnership won't be able to identify significant participation passive activities.

# Certain nondepreciable rental property activities.

Net passive income from a rental activity is nonpassive income if less than 30% of the unadjusted basis of the property used or held for use by customers in the activity is subject to depreciation under section 167.

# Passive equity-financed lending activities.

If the partnership has net income from a passive equity-financed lending activity, the smaller of the net passive income or the equity-financed interest income from the activity is nonpassive income.

# Rental of property incidental to a development activity.

Net rental activity income is the excess of passive activity gross income from renting or disposing of property over passive activity deductions (current year deductions and prior year unallowed losses) that are reasonably allocable to the rented property. Net rental activity income is nonpassive income for a partner if all of the following apply.

# Passive Activity Reporting Requirements

To allow partners to correctly apply the passive activity loss and credit limitation rules, the partnership must do the following.

1. If the partnership carries on more than one activity, provide an attached statement for each activity conducted through the partnership that identifies the type of activity conducted (trade or business, rental real estate, or rental activity other than rental real estate). See Grouping Activities, earlier.
2. On the attached statement for each activity, provide a statement, using the same box numbers as shown on Schedule K-1, detailing the net income (loss), credits, and all items required to be separately stated under section 702(a) from each trade or business activity, from each rental real estate activity, from each rental activity other than a rental real estate activity, and from investments. If the partnership grouped separate activities, the attachments must identify each group. The attached group activity description must be sufficient for a partner to determine if its other activities qualify to be grouped with any groups provided by the partnership.
3. Identify the net income (loss) and credits from each oil or gas well drilled or operated under a working interest that any partner (other than a partner whose only interest in the partnership during the year is as a limited partner) holds through the partnership. Further, if any partner had an interest as a general partner in the partnership during less than the entire year, the partnership must identify both the disqualified deductions from each well that the partner must treat as passive activity deductions, and the ratable portion of the gross income from each well that the partner must treat as passive activity gross income.

18 Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)
---
# 4. Identify the net income (loss) and the partner's share of gain represented more than 10% of the partner's total gain from partnership interest expense from each activity of renting a dwelling unit that any partner uses for personal purposes during the year for more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the number of days that the residence is rented at fair rental value.

# 5. Identify the net income (loss) and the partner's share of partnership interest expense from each activity of trading personal property conducted through the partnership.

# 6. For any gain (loss) from the disposition of an interest in an activity or of an interest in property used in an activity (including dispositions before 1987 from which gain is being recognized after 1986):

- a. Identify the activity in which the property was used at the time of disposition;
- b. If the property was used in more than one activity during the 12 months preceding the disposition, identify the activities in which the property was used and the adjusted basis allocated to each activity; and
- c. For gains only, if the property was substantially appreciated at the time of the disposition and the applicable holding period specified in Regulations section 1.469-2(c)(2)(iii)(A) wasn't satisfied, identify the amount of the nonpassive gain and indicate whether the gain is investment income under Regulations section 1.469-2(c)(2)(iii)(F).

# 7. Specify the amount of gross portfolio income, the interest expense properly allocable to portfolio income, and expenses other than interest expense that are clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income.

# 8. Identify separately any of the following types of payments to partners.

- a. Payments to a partner for services other than in the partner's capacity as a partner under section 707(a).
- b. Guaranteed payments to a partner for services under section 707(c).
- c. Guaranteed payments for use of capital.
- d. If section 736(a)(2) payments are made for unrealized receivables or for goodwill, the amount of the payments and the activities to which the payments are attributable.
- e. If section 736(b) payments are made, the amount of the payments and the activities to which the payments are attributable.

# 9. Identify the ratable portion of any section 481 adjustment (whether a net positive or a net negative adjustment) allocable to each partnership activity.

# 10. Identify the amount of gross income from each oil or gas property of the partnership.

# 11. Identify any gross income from sources specifically excluded from passive activity gross income, including:

- a. Income from intangible property if the partner is an individual whose personal efforts significantly contributed to the creation of the property;
- b. Income from state, local, or foreign income tax refunds;
- c. Income from a covenant not to compete if the partner is an individual who contributed the covenant to the partnership.

# 12. Identify any deductions that aren't passive activity deductions.

# 13. If the partnership makes a full or partial disposition of its interest in another entity, identify the gain (loss) allocable to each activity conducted through the entity, and the gain allocable to a passive activity that would have been recharacterized as nonpassive gain had the partnership disposed of its interest in property used in the activity (because the property was substantially appreciated at the time of the disposition, and the partner disposed of an interest in the partnership).

# Net Investment Income Tax Reporting Requirements

The information described in this section should be given directly to the partner and shouldn't be reported by the partnership to the IRS.

To allow partners to correctly figure the net investment income tax (NIIT) where a partner disposes of an interest in the partnership during the tax year, the partnership may be required to provide the partner with certain information. The NIIT is a tax imposed on an individual’s, trust’s, or estate’s net investment income. Net investment income includes the net gains or losses from the sale of an interest in the partnership. A partner who is actively involved in one or more of the partnership’s or lower-tier pass-through entities’ trades or businesses (other than trading in financial instruments or commodities) can reduce the amount of the gain or loss from the sale of the partnership or lower-tier pass-through entity interest included in its net investment income. However, to figure its net investment income, the active partner needs certain information from the partnership.

Generally, the partnership must provide certain information to the partner if the partnership knows, or has reason to know, the following:

- The partner disposed of an interest in the partnership.
---
• The partner materially participates (within the meaning of the passive activity loss rules (section 469)) in one or more of the trades or businesses (within the meaning of section 162) of the partnership or a lower-tier pass-through entity (other than trading in financial instruments or commodities).

• The partner doesn't qualify for the optional simplified reporting method for figuring its net investment income associated with the disposition of the interest. For more information, see the instructions for Form 8960, line 5c.

Information to be provided to partner. Generally, the partnership must provide the partner with its distributive share of the net gain and loss from the deemed sale for FMV of the partnership’s property, other than property that relates to the trades or businesses in which the partner materially participates, as determined under the passive activity loss rules applicable to the transfer of an interest in a pass-through entity. For more information, see the instructions for Form 8960, line 5c.

If a partner who qualifies for the optional simplified reporting method prefers to determine net gain or loss under the general calculation, the partnership may, but isn't obligated to, provide the information to the partner at that partner’s request.

# Specific Instructions

These instructions follow the line numbers on the first page of Form 1065. The accompanying schedules are discussed separately. Specific instructions for most of the lines are provided. Lines that aren't discussed are self-explanatory.

Fill in all applicable lines and schedules.

Enter any items specially allocated to the partners in the appropriate box of the applicable partner's Schedule K-1. Enter the total amount on the appropriate line of Schedule K. Don't enter separately stated amounts on the numbered lines on Form 1065; Form 1125-A, page 1; or Schedule D (Form 1065).

File all six pages of Form 1065. However, if the answer to Schedule B, question 4, is “Yes,” Schedules L, M-1, and M-2 on page 6 are optional. Also attach a Schedule K-1 to Form 1065 for each partner.

File only one Form 1065 for each partnership. Mark “Duplicate Copy” on any copy you give to a partner.

If a syndicate, pool, joint venture, or similar group files Form 1065, it must attach a copy of the agreement and all amendments to the return, unless a copy has previously been filed.

A foreign partnership required to file a return must generally report all of its foreign and U.S. partnership items. For rules regarding whether a foreign partnership must file Form 1065, see Who Must File, earlier.

# Name and Address

Enter the legal name of the partnership, address, and EIN on the appropriate lines. If the partnership has changed its name, check box G(3). Include the suite, room, or other unit number after the street address. If the post office doesn't deliver mail to the street address and the partnership has a P.O. box, show the box number instead.

If the partnership receives its mail in care of a third party (such as an accountant or an attorney), enter “C/O” on the street address line, followed by the third party’s name and street address or P.O. box.

If the partnership's address is outside the United States or U.S. territories, enter the information on the line for “City or town, state or province, country, and ZIP or foreign postal code” in the address.

# Item D. Employer Identification Number (EIN)

Show the correct EIN in item D. If the partnership doesn't have an EIN, it must apply for one in one of the following ways.

- Online—Go to IRS.gov/EIN. The EIN is issued immediately once the application information is validated.
- By mailing or faxing Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number.

An LLC must determine which type of federal tax entity it will be (partnership, corporation, or disregarded entity (DE)) before applying for an EIN (see Form 8832 for details). If the partnership hasn't received its EIN by the time the return is due, enter “Applied for” and the application date in the space for the EIN.

For more details, see the Instructions for Form SS-4.

Note. The online application process isn't yet available for partnerships with addresses in foreign countries. If you're located outside the United States, call 267-941-1099.

# Item F. Total Assets

You aren't required to complete item F if the answer to Schedule B, question 4, is “Yes.”
---
If you're required to complete this item, enter the partnership's total assets at the end of the tax year, as determined by the accounting method regularly used in keeping the partnership's books and records. If there were no assets at the end of the tax year, enter zero.

# Item J. Schedule C and Schedule M-3

A partnership must file Schedule M-3, Net Income (Loss) Reconciliation for Certain Partnerships, instead of Schedule M-1, if any of the following apply.

- The amount of total assets at the end of the tax year reported on Schedule L, line 14, column (d), is $10 million or more.
- The amount of adjusted total assets for the tax year is $10 million or more. Adjusted total assets is defined in the Instructions for Schedule M-3.
- The amount of total receipts (as defined later in the instructions for Schedule B, question 4) for the tax year is $35 million or more.
- An entity that is a reportable entity partner of the partnership owns or is deemed to own, directly or indirectly, an interest of 50% or more in the partnership's capital, profit, or loss on any day during the tax year of the partnership. Reportable entity partner is defined in the Instructions for Schedule M-3.

A partnership filing Form 1065 that isn't required to file Schedule M-3 may voluntarily file Schedule M-3 instead of Schedule M-1.

Any partnership that files Schedule M-3 must also complete and file Schedule C (Form 1065), Additional Information for Schedule M-3 Filers. See Eased requirements next.

# Eased requirements.

Partnerships that (a) are required to file Schedule M-3 and have less than $50 million in total assets at tax-year-end, or (b) aren't required to file Schedule M-3 and voluntarily file Schedule M-3, must either (i) complete Schedule M-3 entirely, or (ii) complete Schedule M-3 through Part I and complete Schedule M-1 instead of completing Parts II and III of Schedule M-3.

In addition, partnerships that meet the requirements of (a) and (b) above aren't required to file Schedule C (Form 1065) or Form 8916-A.

See the instructions for Schedule C and Schedule M-3 for more information.

# Income

Report only trade or business activity income on lines 1a through 8. Don't report rental activity income or portfolio income on these lines. If a cost offset method under section 451(b) or (c) is used, the resulting gross income is reported on line 1a.

Special rules apply to certain income, as discussed below. For example, don't include gross receipts from farming on line 1a. Instead, show the net profit (loss) from farming on line 5.

Also, don't include on line 1a rental activity income or portfolio income.

In general, advance payments are reported in the year of receipt. For exceptions to this general rule for partnerships that use the accrual method of accounting, see the following.

- To report income from long-term contracts, see section 460.
- For permissible methods that allow a limited deferral of advance payments beyond the current tax year, see section 451(c) and Regulations section 1.451-8.
- For information on adopting or changing to a permissible method for reporting advance payment for goods and services by an accrual method partnership, see the Instructions for Form 3115.

# Installment sales.

Generally, the installment method can't be used for dealer dispositions of property. A dealer disposition is any disposition of:

- Personal property by a person who regularly sells or otherwise disposes of personal property of the same type on the installment plan, or
- Real property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.

Exception. These restrictions on using the installment method don't apply to dispositions of property used or produced in a farming business or sales of timeshares and residential lots. However, if the partnership elects to report dealer dispositions of timeshares and residential lots on the installment method, each partner's tax liability must be increased by the partner's distributive share of the interest payable under section 453(l)(3).

Include on line 1a the gross profit on collections from installment sales for any of the following.

- Dealer dispositions of property before March 1, 1986.
- Dispositions of property used or produced in the trade or business of farming.
- Certain dispositions of timeshares and residential lots reported under the installment method.

Attach a statement showing the following information for the current year and the 3 preceding years.

- Gross sales.
- Cost of goods sold.
- Gross profits.
- Percentage of gross profits to gross sales.
- Amount collected.
- Gross profit on the amount collected.

Nonaccrual-experience method. Partnerships that qualify to use the nonaccrual-experience method (described earlier) should attach a statement showing total gross receipts, the amount not accrued as a result of the application of section 448(d)(5), and the net amount accrued. Include the net amount on line 1a.

# Line 2. Cost of Goods Sold

Report tax-exempt interest income, including exempt-interest dividends received as a shareholder in a mutual fund or other RIC, on Schedule K, line 18a, and in box 18 of Schedule K-1 using code A.

See Deductions, later, for information on how to report expenses related to tax-exempt income.

# Line 1a. Gross Receipts or Sales

If the partnership has a cost of goods sold deduction, complete and attach Form 1125-A. Enter on Form 1065, page 1, line 2, the amount from Form 1125-A, line 8. See Form 1125-A and its instructions.

# Line 4. Ordinary Income (Loss) From Other Partnerships, Estates, and Trusts

Enter the ordinary income (loss) shown on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) or Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), or other ordinary income (loss) from a foreign partnership, estate, or trust. Show the
---
# Partnership's, Estate's, or Trust's Name, Address, and EIN

Line 7. Other Income (Loss)

Enter any other trade or business income (loss) not included on lines 1a through 6. List the type and amount of income on an attached statement. Examples of other income include the following.

- Interest income derived in the ordinary course of the partnership's trade or business, such as interest charged on receivable balances.
- Recoveries of bad debts deducted in prior years under the specific charge-off method.
- Taxable income from insurance proceeds.
- Any amount included in income from Form 6478, Biofuel Producer Credit, line 2, if applicable.
- Any amount included in income from Form 8864, line 9, if applicable.
- The recapture amount under section 280F if the business use of listed property drops to 50% or less. To figure the recapture amount, complete Form 4797, Part IV.
- All section 481 income adjustments resulting from changes in accounting methods. Show the computation of the section 481 adjustments on an attached statement.
- Part or all of the proceeds received from certain employer-owned life insurance contracts issued after August 17, 2006. Partnerships that own one or more employer-owned life insurance contracts issued after that date must file Form 8925, Report of Employer-Owned Life Insurance Contracts. See section 101(j) for details.

Line 5. Net Farm Profit (Loss)

Enter the partnership's net farm profit (loss) from Schedule F (Form 1040). Attach Schedule F (Form 1040) to Form 1065. Don't include on this line any farm profit (loss) from other partnerships. Report those amounts on line 4. In figuring the partnership's net farm profit (loss), don't include any section 179 expense deduction; this amount must be separately stated.

Also report the partnership's fishing income on this line. For a special rule concerning the method of accounting for a farming partnership with a corporate partner and for other tax information on farms, see Pub. 225, Farmer's Tax Guide.

Because the partner, and not the partnership, makes the election to deduct the expenses of raising any plant with a preproductive period of more than 2 years, farm partnerships that aren't required to use an accrual method shouldn't capitalize such expenses. Instead, state them separately on an attached statement to Schedule K, line 13e, and in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code P. See section 263A(d) for more information.

Line 6. Net Gain (Loss) From Form 4797

Report only trade or business activity deductions on lines 9 through 21.

CAUTION: Don't report the following expenses on lines 9 through 21.

- Rental activity expenses. Report these expenses on Form 8825 or Schedule K, line 3b.
- Deductions allocable to portfolio income. Report these deductions on Schedule K, line 13e, and in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code I or L.
- Nondeductible expenses (for example, expenses connected with the production of tax-exempt income). Report nondeductible expenses on Schedule K, line 18c, and in box 18 of Schedule K-1 using code C.
- Qualified expenditures to which an election under section 59(e) may apply. The instructions for Schedule K, line 13d, and for box 13, code J, of Schedule K-1 explain how to report these amounts.

Include only ordinary gains or losses from the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of assets used in a trade or business activity. Ordinary gains or losses from the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of rental activity assets are reported separately on Form 8825, line 19, or Schedule K, line 3c, and in box 3 of Schedule K-1, generally as a part of the net income (loss) from the rental activity.

A partnership that is a partner in another partnership must include on Form 4797 its share of ordinary gains (losses) from sales, exchanges, or involuntary conversions (other than casualties or thefts) of the other partnership's trade or business assets.

Partnerships shouldn't use Form 4797 to report the sale or other disposition of property if a section 179 expense deduction was previously passed through to any of its partners for that property. Instead, report it in box 20 of Schedule K-1 using code L. See Dispositions of property with section 179 deductions (code L), later, for details.

Items the partnership must state separately that require separate computations by the partners. Examples include expenses incurred for the production of income instead of in a trade or business, charitable contributions, foreign taxes paid or accrued, intangible drilling and development costs, soil and water conservation expenditures, amortizable basis of reforestation expenditures, and exploration expenditures. The distributive shares of these expenses are reported separately to each partner on Schedule K-1.

# Limitations on Deductions

Section 263A uniform capitalization rules. The uniform capitalization rules of section 263A generally require partnerships to capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with the following.
---
# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

The production of real property and tangible personal property held in inventory or held for sale in the ordinary course of business.

Real property or personal property (tangible and intangible) acquired for resale.

The production of real property and tangible personal property by a partnership for use in its trade or business or in an activity engaged in for profit.

Tangible personal property produced by a partnership includes a film, sound recording, videotape, book, or similar property.

The costs required to be capitalized under section 263A aren't deductible until the property to which the costs relate is sold, used, or otherwise disposed of by the partnership.

# Exceptions

For tax years beginning after 2017, a small business taxpayer, defined earlier, can adopt or change its method of accounting to not capitalize costs under section 263A. See section 263A(i) and Accounting Methods, earlier.

Section 263A doesn't apply to the following:

- Timber.
- Most property produced under a long-term contract.
- Certain property produced in a farming business. See the note at the end of the instructions for line 5, earlier.
- Geological and geophysical costs amortized under section 167(h).
- Certain plants bearing fruits and nuts under section 168(k)(5).

The partnership must report the following costs separately to the partners for purposes of determinations under section 59(e):

- R&E costs under section 174.
- Intangible drilling costs for oil, gas, and geothermal property.
- Mining exploration and development costs.

# Indirect costs

Partnerships subject to the uniform capitalization rules are required to capitalize not only direct costs but an allocable part of most indirect costs (including taxes) that benefit the assets produced or acquired for resale, or are incurred because of the performance of production or resale activities.

For inventory, indirect costs that must be capitalized include the following:

- Administration expenses.
- Taxes.
- Depreciation.
- Insurance.
- Compensation paid to officers attributable to services.
- Rework labor.
- Contributions to pension, stock bonus, and certain profit-sharing, annuity, or deferred compensation plans.

Regulations section 1.263A-1(e)(3) specifies other indirect costs that relate to production or resale activities that must be capitalized and those that may be currently deductible.

Interest expense paid or incurred during the production period of designated property must be capitalized and is governed by special rules. For more details, see Regulations sections 1.263A-8 through -15.

For more details on the uniform capitalization rules, see Regulations sections 1.263A-1 through -3.

# Transactions between related taxpayers

Generally, an accrual basis partnership can deduct business expenses and interest owed to a related party (including any partner) only in the tax year of the partnership that includes the day on which the payment is includible in the income of the related party. See section 267 for details.

# Business interest

Business interest expense (BIE) is limited for tax years beginning after 2017. See section 163(j) for limitations on deductions for business interest, and section 163(j)(4) for rules specific to partnerships.

# Business startup and organizational costs

Generally, a partnership can elect to deduct a limited amount of startup or organizational costs paid or incurred. Any costs not deducted must be amortized as explained below. See sections 195(b) and 709(b).

# Time for making an election

The partnership generally elects to deduct startup or organizational costs by claiming the deduction on its return filed by the due date (including extensions) for the tax year in which the active trade or business begins.

If the partnership timely filed its return for the year without making an election, it can still make an election by filing an amended return within 6 months of the due date of the return (excluding extensions). Clearly indicate the election on the amended return and enter “Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2” at the top of the amended return. File the amended return at the same address the partnership filed its original return. The election applies when figuring income for the current tax year and all subsequent years.

The partnership can choose to forgo the above elections by clearly electing to capitalize its startup or organizational costs on its return filed by the due date (including extensions) for the tax year in which the active trade or business begins.

The election to either amortize or capitalize startup or organizational costs is irrevocable and applies to all startup and organizational costs that are related to the trade or business.

# Amortization

Any costs not deducted under the above rules must be amortized ratably over a 180-month period, beginning with the month the partnership begins business. See the Instructions for Form 4562 for details.

Report the deductible amount of these costs and any amortization on line 21. For amortization that began during the tax year, complete and attach Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization.

# Syndication costs

Costs for issuing and marketing interests in the partnership, such as commissions, professional fees, and printing costs, must be capitalized. They can't be depreciated or amortized. See the instructions for line 10, later, for the treatment of syndication fees paid to a partner.

# Reducing certain expenses for which credits are allowable

The partnership may need to reduce the otherwise allowable deductions for expenses used to figure certain credits. The following are examples of such credits. (Don't reduce the amount of the allowable deduction for any portion of the credit that was passed through to the partnership from another pass-through entity.)

- Work opportunity credit.
- Credit for increasing research activities.
- Disabled access credit.
- Empowerment zone employment credit, if applicable.
- Credit for employer social security and Medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips.
- Orphan drug credit.
- Credit for small employer pension plan startup costs (including employer contributions).
- Credit for employer-provided childcare facilities and services.
- Low sulfur diesel fuel production credit.
- Credit for employer differential wage payments.
- Credit for small employer health insurance premiums.
- Employer credit for paid family and medical leave (Form 8994).

Note. Wages taken into account in determining the credit for qualified sick and family leave on Form 941 can't be taken into account in determining the employer credit for paid family and medical leave on Form 8994. See the Instructions for Form 8994.
---
# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

If the partnership has any of the credits listed above, figure each current year credit before figuring the deductions for expenses on which the credit is based.

# Line 9. Salaries and Wages

Enter the salaries and wages paid or incurred for the tax year, reduced by the amount of the following credit(s):

- Work Opportunity Credit (Form 5884).
- Empowerment Zone Employment Credit (Form 8844), if applicable.
- Credit for Employer Differential Wage Payments (Form 8932).

Don't reduce the amount of the allowable deduction for any portion of the credit that was passed through to the partnership from another pass-through entity. See the instructions for the credit form for more information.

Don't include salaries and wages reported elsewhere on the return, such as amounts included in cost of goods sold, elective contributions to a section 401(k) cash or deferred arrangement, or amounts contributed under a salary reduction SEP agreement or a SIMPLE IRA plan.

# Line 10. Guaranteed Payments to Partners

Deduct payments or credits to a partner for services or for the use of capital if the payments or credits are determined without regard to partnership income and are allocable to a trade or business activity. Also include on line 10 amounts paid during the tax year for insurance that constitutes medical care for a partner, a partner's spouse, a partner's dependents, or a partner's children under age 27 who aren't dependents.

For information on how to treat the partnership's contribution to a partner's health savings account (HSA), see Notice 2005-8, 2005-4 I.R.B. 368.

Don't include any payments and credits that should be capitalized. For example, although payments or credits to a partner for services rendered in syndicating a partnership may be guaranteed payments, they aren't deductible on line 10. They are capital expenditures. However, they should be reported as guaranteed payments on the applicable line of Schedule K, line 4b, and in box 4b of Schedule K-1.

Don't include distributive shares of partnership profits. Report the guaranteed payments to the appropriate partners using the applicable box 4 of Schedule K-1.

# Line 11. Repairs and Maintenance

Enter the cost of repairs and maintenance not claimed elsewhere on the return, such as labor and supplies, that aren't payments for improvements to the partnership’s property. Amounts are paid for improvements if they’re for betterments to the property or for restorations of the property (such as the replacements of major components or substantial structural parts), or if they adapt the property to a new or different use. Improvements must be capitalized. See Regulations section 1.263(a)-3.

The partnership can deduct repair and maintenance expenses only to the extent they relate to a trade or business activity. See Regulations section 1.162-4. The partnership may elect to capitalize certain repair and maintenance costs consistent with its books and records. See Regulations section 1.263(a)-3(n) for information on how to make the election.

# Line 12. Bad Debts

Enter the total debts that became worthless in whole or in part during the year, but only to the extent such debts relate to a trade or business activity. Report deductible nonbusiness bad debts as a short-term capital loss on Form 8949.

# Line 13. Rent

Enter rent paid on business property used in a trade or business activity. Don't deduct rent for a dwelling unit occupied by any partner for personal use.

If the partnership rented or leased a vehicle, enter the total annual rent or lease expense paid or incurred in the trade or business activities of the partnership. Also complete Form 4562, Part V. If the partnership leased a vehicle for a term of 30 days or more, the deduction for vehicle lease expense may have to be reduced by an amount called the inclusion amount. The partnership may have an inclusion amount if:

|Lease Term Began:|And the Vehicle's FMV on the First Day of the Lease Exceeded:|
|---|---|
|During calendar year 2024|$62,000|
|During calendar year 2023|$60,000|
|During calendar year 2022|$56,000|
|During calendar year 2021|$51,000|
|After 12/31/2017 but before 1/1/2021|$50,000|

|After 12/31/09 but before 1/1/13|$18,500|
|During calendar year 2024|$62,000|
|During calendar year 2023|$60,000|
|During calendar year 2022|$56,000|
|During calendar year 2021|$51,000|
|After 12/31/2017 but before 1/1/2021|$50,000|
|After 12/31/13 and before 1/1/18|$19,500|
|After 12/31/09 and before 1/1/14|$19,000|

The inclusion amount for lease terms beginning in 2025 will be published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin in early 2025.

See Pub. 463, Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses, for instructions on figuring the inclusion amount.

# Line 14. Taxes and Licenses

Enter taxes and licenses paid or incurred in the trade or business activities of the partnership if not reflected elsewhere on the return. Federal import duties and federal excise and stamp taxes are deductible only if paid or incurred in carrying on the trade or business of the partnership. Foreign taxes are included on line 14 only if they are taxes not creditable but deductible under sections 901 and 903. See Schedule K-2, Part II, Section 2, line 45, column (g).

Don't deduct the following taxes on line 14:

- Taxes not imposed on the partnership.
- Federal income taxes or taxes reported elsewhere on the return.
- Creditable foreign taxes under sections 901 and 903. Report these taxes separately on Schedule K, line 21, and in box 21 of Schedule K-1.
- Taxes allocable to a rental activity. Report taxes allocable to rental real estate activity on Form 8825. Report taxes allocable to a rental activity other than a rental real estate activity on Schedule K, line 3b.
- Taxes paid or incurred for the production or collection of income, or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held to produce income. Report these taxes separately.
---
on Schedule K, line 13e, and in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code ZZ.

- Interest paid by a partnership to a partner for the use of capital, which should be entered on line 10 as guaranteed payments.
- See section 263A(a) for rules on capitalization of allocable costs (including taxes) for any property.
- Taxes, including state or local sales taxes, that are paid or incurred in connection with an acquisition or disposition of property (these taxes must be treated as a part of the cost of the acquired property or, in the case of a disposition, as a reduction in the amount realized on the disposition).
- Taxes assessed against local benefits that increase the value of the property assessed (such as for paving, etc.).

See section 164(d) for information on apportionment of taxes on real property between seller and purchaser.

# Line 15. Interest

Include only interest incurred in the trade or business activities of the partnership that isn't claimed elsewhere on the return.

Don't include interest expense on the following:

- Debt used to purchase rental property or debt used in a rental activity. Interest allocable to a rental real estate activity is reported on Form 8825 and is used in arriving at net income (loss) from rental real estate activities on Schedule K, line 2, and in box 2 of Schedule K-1. Interest allocable to a rental activity other than a rental real estate activity is included on Schedule K, line 3b, and is used in arriving at net income (loss) from a rental activity (other than a rental real estate activity). This net amount is reported on Schedule K, line 3c, and in box 3 of Schedule K-1.
- Debt used to buy property held for investment. Interest that is clearly and directly allocable to interest, dividend, royalty, or annuity income not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business is reported on Schedule K, line 13c, and in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code H.

See the instructions for Schedule K, line 13c; box 13, code H, of Schedule K-1; and Form 4952, Investment Interest Expense Deduction, for more information on investment property.

- Debt proceeds allocated to distributions made to partners during the tax year. Instead, report such interest on Schedule K, line 13e, and in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code AC.
- Debt required to be allocated to the production of designated property. Designated property includes real property, personal property that has a class life of 20 years or more, and other tangible property requiring more than 2 years (1 year in the case of property with a cost of more than $1 million) to produce or construct. Interest allocable to designated property produced by a partnership for its own use or for sale must be capitalized.

Complete and attach Form 4562 only if the partnership placed property in service during the tax year or claims depreciation on any car or other listed property.

Don't include any section 179 expense deduction on this line. This amount isn't deducted by the partnership. Instead, it's passed through to the partners in box 12 of Schedule K-1.

# Line 16. Depreciation

On line 16a, enter only the depreciation claimed on assets used in a trade or business activity. Enter on line 16b the depreciation included elsewhere on the return (for example, on page 1, line 2) that is attributable to assets used in trade or business activities.

See the Instructions for Form 4562, or Pub. 946, How To Depreciate Property, to figure the amount of depreciation to enter on this line.

# Line 17. Depletion

If the partnership claims a deduction for timber depletion, complete and attach Form T (Timber), Forest Activities Schedule.

Don't deduct depletion for oil and gas properties. Each partner figures depletion on oil and gas properties. See the instructions for Schedule K-1, box 20, Depletion information oil and gas (code T), for the information on oil and gas depletion that must be supplied to the partners by the partnership.

CAUTION: Special rules apply to the following. Allocating interest expense among activities so that the limitations on passive activity losses, investment interest, and personal interest can be properly figured. Generally, interest expense is allocated in the same manner as debt is allocated. Debt is allocated by tracing disbursements of the debt proceeds to specific expenditures. Temporary Regulations section 1.163-8T gives rules for tracing debt proceeds to expenditures. Also see Proposed Regulations 1.163-14 for a special rule for allocating interest expense with respect to pass-through entities.

# Retirement Plans, etc.

• Amortization. See the Instructions for Form 4562 for more.

Don't deduct payments for partners to retirement or deferred compensation plans including IRAs, qualified plans, and simplified employee pension (SEP) and SIMPLE IRA plans on this line. These amounts are reported in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code R and are deducted by the partners on their own returns.

Enter the deductible contributions not claimed elsewhere on the return made by the partnership for its common-law employees under a qualified pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan, and under any other deferred compensation plan.

If the partnership contributes to an IRA for employees, include the contribution in salaries and wages on page 1, line 9, or Form 1125-A, line 3, and not on line 18.

Employers who maintain a pension, profit-sharing, or other funded deferred compensation plan (other than a SEP or SIMPLE IRA), whether or not the plan is qualified under the Code and whether or not a deduction is claimed for the current year, must generally file the applicable form listed below.

- Form 5500, Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan.
- Form 5500-SF, Short Form Annual Return/Report of Small Employee Benefit Plan (generally filed instead of Form 5500 if there are under 100 participants at the beginning of the plan year).

Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF must be filed electronically under the computerized ERISA Filing Acceptance System (EFAST2). For more information, see the EFAST2 website at EFAST.dol.gov.

- Form 5500-EZ, Annual Return of A One-Participant (Owners/Partners and Their Spouses) Retirement Plan or A Foreign Plan. File this form for a plan that only covers one or more partners (or partners and their spouses) or a foreign plan that is required to file an annual return and doesn't file the annual return electronically on Form 5500-SF.

Don't deduct the following on line 21.

- Items that must be reported separately on Schedules K and K-1.
- Fines or similar penalties. Generally, no deduction is allowed for fines or similar penalties paid or incurred to or at the direction of a government or governmental entity for violating any law except amounts that constitute restitution (including remediation of property), amounts paid or incurred to come into compliance with the law, amounts paid or incurred as the result of orders or agreements in which no government or governmental entity is a party, and amounts paid or incurred for taxes due to the extent the amount would have been allowed as a deduction if timely paid. No deduction is allowed unless the amounts are specifically identified in the order or agreement and the taxpayer establishes that the amounts were paid for that purpose. Also, any amount paid or incurred as reimbursement to the government for the costs of any investigation or litigation aren't eligible for the exceptions and are nondeductible. See section 162(f). Report nondeductible amounts on Schedule K, line 18c.
- Expenses allocable to tax-exempt income. Report these expenses on Schedule K, line 18c.
- Net operating losses. Only individuals and corporations may claim a net operating loss deduction.

These expenses include amounts paid or incurred in connection with influencing federal, state, or local legislation; or amounts paid or incurred in connection with any communication with certain federal executive branch officials in an attempt to influence the official actions or positions of the officials. See Regulations section 1.162-29 for the definition of “influencing legislation.” Dues and other similar amounts paid to certain tax-exempt organizations may not be deductible. If certain in-house lobbying expenditures don't exceed $2,000, the general rule denying deductions for lobbying expenses doesn’t apply to these amounts. See section 162(e)(4)(B).
- Amounts paid or incurred for any settlement or payout related to sexual harassment or sexual abuse that is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, as well as any attorney’s fees related to the settlement or payout. See section 162(q).

- That individual is an employee of the partnership, and
- The travel is for a bona fide business purpose and would otherwise be deductible by that individual.

Membership dues. The partnership may deduct amounts paid or incurred for membership dues in civic or public service organizations, professional organizations (such as bar and medical associations), business leagues, trade associations, chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and real estate boards. However, no deduction is allowed if a principal purpose of the organization is to entertain, or provide entertainment facilities for, members or their guests. In addition, the partnership may not deduct membership dues in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose. This includes country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, airline and hotel clubs, and clubs operated to provide meals under conditions favorable to business discussion.

Entertainment facilities. The partnership can't deduct an expense paid or incurred for a facility (such as a yacht or hunting lodge) used for an activity usually considered entertainment, amusement, or recreation.

Reforestation expenditures. If the partnership made an election to deduct a portion of its reforestation expenditures on Schedule K, line 13e, it must amortize over an 84-month period the portion of these expenditures in excess of the amount deducted on Schedule K (see section 194). Deduct on line 21 only the amortization of these excess reforestation expenditures. See Reforestation expense deduction (code S), later.

corporate stock. An interest in the partnership that is owned interests owned, directly or indirectly, in the profit, loss, or capital directly or indirectly by an integral part or controlled entity of a foreign sovereign (within the meaning of Temporary Regulations section 1.892-2T(a)) is considered to be owned proportionately by such foreign sovereign.

Constructive ownership examples for questions 2 and 3 are included below. For the purposes of questions 2 and 3, add an owner's direct percentage ownership and indirect percentage ownership in an entity to determine if the owner owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the entity.

# Question 4

Answer “Yes” if the partnership meets all four of the requirements shown on the form. “Total receipts” is defined as the sum of gross receipts or sales (page 1, line 1a); all other income (page 1, lines 4 through 7); income reported on Schedule K, lines 3a, 5, 6a, and 7; income or net gain reported on Schedule K, lines 8, 9a, 10, and 11; and income or net gain reported on Form 8825, lines 2, 19, and 20a. “Total assets” is defined as the amount that would be reported in item F on page 1 of Form 1065.

# Question 5

Answer “Yes” if interests in the partnership are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or its substantial equivalent).

# Question 6

Generally, the partnership will have income if debt is canceled or forgiven. Amounts related to forgiven Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans are disregarded for purposes of this question. The determination of the existence and amount of cancellation of debt income is determined at the partnership level. Partnership cancellation of indebtedness income is separately stated on Schedule K and Schedule K-1. The extent to which such income is taxable is usually determined by each individual partner under rules found in section 108. For more information, see Pub. 334, Tax Guide for Small Business.

# Question 7

Constructive ownership of other entities by the partnership. For purposes of determining the partnership's constructive ownership of other entities, the constructive ownership rules of section 267(c) (excluding section 267(c)(3)) apply to ownership of interests in partnerships and trusts as well as corporate stock. Generally, if an entity (a corporation, partnership, or trust) is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for another entity (corporation, partnership, estate, or trust), the owned entity is considered to be owned proportionally by or for the owners (shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries) of the owning entity.

# Question 8

Answer “Yes” if either (1) or (2) below applies to the partnership. Otherwise, answer “No.”

1. At any time during calendar year 2024, the partnership had an interest in or signature or other authority over a bank account, securities account, or other financial account in a foreign country (see FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR)); and

• It's treated as the owner of any part of the assets of a foreign trust under the grantor trust rules.

• It received a distribution, a loan of cash or other marketable securities, or uncompensated use of trust property from a foreign trust, or a foreign trust holds an outstanding qualified obligation of the partnership.

For more information, see the Instructions for Form 3520.

An owner of a foreign trust must ensure that the trust files an annual information return on Form 3520-A, Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a U.S. Owner.

# Questions 10a, 10b, 10c, and 10d

You must answer “Yes” or “No” for each question.

TIP

# Question 10a.

Answer “Yes” if the partnership is making, or has made (and hasn't revoked), a section 754 election. For information about the election, see item 4 under Elections Made by the Partnership, earlier.

# Question 10b.

Answer “Yes” if either of the following has occurred.

- The partnership made an optional basis adjustment under section 743(b) or 734(b) for the tax year.
- The partnership has made a section 754 election (and it hasn't been revoked) and a basis adjustment under section 743(b) is made on a sale or exchange of a partnership interest or a transfer of a partnership interest on the death of a partner. See question 10c if the partnership has a substantial built-in loss immediately after such a transfer.

For partnerships other than PTPs, enter the total aggregate positive amount (in the appropriate space provided) resulting from all section 743(b) adjustments. “Aggregate positive amount from all section 743(b) adjustments” means the increase in the partners' shares of basis in partnership property from all section 743(b) adjustments allocated to all the partners. Enter the total aggregate negative amount (in the appropriate space provided) resulting from all section 743(b) adjustments. “Aggregate negative amount from all section 743(b) adjustments” means the decrease in the partners' shares of basis in partnership property from all section 743(b) adjustments allocated to all the partners.

# Section 743(b) basis adjustment.

The basis adjustment affects only the transferee's basis in partnership property. The partnership must attach a statement to the return for the tax year in which the transfer occurred. The statement must include:

- The name of the transferee partner,
- The EIN or SSN of the transferee partner,
- The computation of the adjustment, and
- The identity of the partnership properties to which the adjustment has been allocated.

For details, see section 743 and Regulations section 1.743-1. For details on allocating the basis adjustment to partnership properties, see section 755 and Regulations section 1.755-1.

# Question 10c.

Answer “Yes” if the partnership made an optional basis adjustment under section 734(b) for the tax year.

# Question 23

The limitation on BIE applies to every taxpayer with a trade or business, unless the taxpayer meets certain specified exceptions. A partnership may elect out of the limitation for certain businesses otherwise subject to the BIE limitation.

Certain real property trades or businesses and farming businesses qualify to make an election not to limit BIE. This is an irrevocable election. If you make this election, you're required to use the alternative depreciation system to depreciate certain property. Also, you aren’t entitled to the special depreciation allowance for that property. For a partnership with more than one qualifying business, the election is made with respect to each business. Answer “Yes” if the partnership has an election in effect to exclude a real property trade or business or a farming business from section 163(j). For more information, see section 163(j) and the Instructions for Form 8990.

# Question 24

Generally, a taxpayer with a trade or business must file Form 8990 to claim a deduction for business interest. BIE is interest that is properly allocable to a non-excepted trade or business or that is floor plan financing interest. In addition, Form 8990 must be filed by any taxpayer that owns an interest in a partnership with current year, or prior year carryover, excess business interest expense (EBIE) allocated from the partnership. A pass-through entity allocating excess taxable income or excess business interest income to its owners (that is, a pass-through entity that isn't a small business taxpayer) must file Form 8990, regardless of whether it has any interest expense.

Exclusions from filing. A taxpayer isn't required to file Form 8990 if the taxpayer is a small business taxpayer and doesn't have EBIE from a partnership. A taxpayer is also not required to file Form 8990 if the taxpayer only has BIE from the following excepted trades or businesses.

- The trade or business of providing services as an employee.
- An electing real property trade or business.
- An electing farming business.
- Certain utility businesses.

Small business taxpayer. A small business taxpayer isn't subject to the BIE limitation and isn't required to file Form 8990. A small business taxpayer is a taxpayer that (a) isn't a tax shelter (as defined in section 448(d)(3)); and (b) meets the gross receipts test of section 448(c), discussed next.

# Question 20

For tax years beginning after 2015, domestic partnerships that are formed or availed of to hold specified foreign financial assets (specified domestic entities) must file Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, with its Form 1065 for the tax year. Form 8938 must be filed each year the value of the partnership’s specified foreign financial assets meets or exceeds the reporting threshold. For more information on domestic partnerships that are specified domestic entities and the types of foreign financial assets that must be reported, see the Instructions for Form 8938.

A domestic partnership required to file Form 8938 with its Form 1065 for the tax year should answer “Yes” to this question.

# Question 22

Section 267A disallows a deduction for certain interest or royalty paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid arrangement, to the extent that, under the foreign tax law, there isn't a corresponding income inclusion (including long-term deferral). On the entry line for question 22, report the total amount of interest and royalty paid or accrued by the partnership for which the partnership knows, or has reason to know, that one or more partners' distributive shares of deductions is disallowed under section 267A. For additional information, see FAQs at IRS.gov/

# Question 25

To be certified as a QOF, the partnership must file Form 1065 and attach Form 8996, even if the partnership had no income or expenses to report. If the partnership is attaching Form 8996, answer “Yes” to question 25. On the line following the dollar sign, enter the amount from Form 8996, Part III, line 15.

# Question 26

Provide the number of foreign partners subject to section 864(c)(8) as a result of transferring all or a portion of an interest in the partnership if the partnership is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. Section 864(c)(8) provides that gain or loss of a foreign transferor from the transfer of a partnership interest is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States to the extent that the transferor would have had effectively connected gain or loss if the partnership sold all of its assets at FMV on the date of transfer.

For purposes of section 864(c)(8), a “transfer of a partnership interest” means a sale, an exchange, or other disposition, and includes a distribution from a partnership to a partner to the extent that gain or loss is recognized on the distribution, as well as a transfer treated as a sale or an exchange under section 707(a)(2)(B). Section 864(c)(8) applies to foreign partners that directly or indirectly transfer an interest in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The partnership should include in its response any transfer for which it has received notification or otherwise knows about. If the partnership is a PTP as defined in section 469(k)(2) and has properly answered “Yes” to question 5 on Form 1065, Schedule B, then it's not required to answer the question.

If a partnership had any foreign partners subject to section 864(c)(8), the partnership must complete Schedule K-3 (Form 1065), Part XIII, for each foreign partner subject to section 864(c)(8) on a transfer or distribution. The partnership may also be required to withhold under section 1446(f)(4) on future distributions that it makes to the transferee partner if that partner failed to withhold on the transfer under section 1446(f)(1). See Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities, for more information.

# Question 27

Answer “Yes” if at any time during the tax year there were transfers between the partnership and its partners subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulations section 1.707-8. For certain transfers that are presumed to be sales, the partnership or the partners must comply with the disclosure requirements in Regulations section 1.707-8. Generally, disclosure is required when:

1. Certain transfers to a partner are made within 2 years of a transfer of property by the partner to the partnership;
2. Certain debt is incurred by a partner within 2 years of the earlier of (a) a written agreement to transfer, or (b) a transfer of the property that secures the debt, if the debt is treated as a qualified liability; or
3. Transfers from a partnership to a partner occur which are the equivalent to those listed in (1) or (2) above.

The information must be reported even if you conclude that section 7874 doesn't apply.

Section 7874 generally applies when the following three requirements are met.

- Pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions, a foreign corporation must acquire directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership.
- After the acquisition, the ownership percentage (by vote or value) must be at least 60%.
- After the acquisition, the expanded affiliate that includes the foreign acquiring corporation must not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which the foreign acquiring corporation is created or organized.

When section 7874 applies, the tax treatment of the acquisition depends on the ownership percentage. If the ownership percentage is at least 80%, the foreign acquiring corporation is treated as a domestic corporation for all purposes of the Code. See section 7874(b). If the ownership percentage is at least 60% but less than 80%, the foreign acquiring corporation is considered a foreign corporation but the domestic partnership and certain other persons are subject to special rules that reduce the tax benefits of the acquisition. See section 7874(a)(1).

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provides additional special rules for certain cases in which section 7874 applies. See sections 59A(d)(4) and 965(l).

# Ownership percentage.

The ownership percentage is the percentage described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii). See the regulations under section 7874 for rules regarding the computation of the ownership percentage.

In general, the ownership percentage measures the percentage of stock of the foreign acquiring corporation that is held by partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership, with certain adjustments (for example, disregarding certain stock of the foreign acquiring corporation attributable to passive assets or assets of other domestic entities that were recently acquired by the foreign acquiring corporation). The ownership percentage is measured separately by vote and value.

Multiple reportable acquisitions. If there are multiple acquisitions that must be reported, list on the lines for question 28 the ownership percentage by vote and value for the most recent acquisition. Attach a statement reporting the ownership percentage by vote and value for the other acquisitions.

# Question 28

Under section 4501, the partnership may be required to file Form 7208, Excise Tax on Repurchase of Corporate Stock, and pay the stock repurchase excise tax if, during the partnership's tax year, (a) the partnership is a specified affiliate of an applicable foreign corporation, or (b) the partnership is an expatriated entity with respect to a covered surrogate foreign corporation. See the Instructions for Form 7208. For additional information, see section 4501.

# Question 30

Section 7874 applies in certain cases in which a foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership. Answer “Yes” if, since December 22, 2017, a foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquired substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of your partnership (and you're a domestic partnership), and the ownership with respect to the acquisition was greater than 50% (by vote or value). If “Yes,” list the ownership percentage by both vote and value.

Answer “Yes” if at any time during 2024, the partnership (a) received (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services) digital assets.

Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)
---
# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

For example, answer “Yes” if at any time during 2024 the partnership:

- Received digital assets as payment for property or services provided;
- Received digital assets as a result of a reward or award;
- Received new digital assets as a result of mining, staking, and similar activities;
- Received digital assets as a result of a hard fork;
- Disposed of digital assets in exchange for property or services;
- Disposed of a digital asset in exchange or trade for another digital asset;
- Sold a digital asset; or otherwise disposed of any other financial interest in a digital asset.

Eligible partners are individuals, C corporations, S corporations, foreign entities that would be C corporations if they were domestic entities, and estates of deceased partners. The determination as to whether the partnership has 100 or fewer partners is made by adding the number of Schedules K-1 required to be issued by the partnership for the tax year to the number of Schedules K-1 required to be issued by any partner that is an S corporation to its shareholders for the tax year of the S corporation ending with or within the partnership tax year. A partnership isn't eligible to elect out of the centralized partnership audit regime if it's required to issue a Schedule K-1 to any of the following partners:

- A partnership.
- A trust.
- A foreign entity that would not be treated as a C corporation if it were a domestic entity.
- A DE described in Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i).
- An estate of an individual other than a deceased partner.
- Any person that holds an interest in the partnership on behalf of another person.

The partnership has a financial interest in a digital asset if it’s the owner of record of a digital asset, or has an ownership stake in an account that holds one or more digital assets, including the rights and obligations to acquire a financial interest, or it owns a wallet that holds digital assets.

The following actions or transactions in 2024, alone, generally don’t require the partnership to answer “Yes.”

- Holding a digital asset in a wallet or account.
- Transferring a digital asset from one wallet or account it owns or controls to another wallet or account that it owns or controls.
- Purchasing digital assets using U.S. or other real currency, including through the use of electronic platforms such as PayPal and Venmo.

Don’t leave the question unanswered. You must answer “Yes” or “No” by checking the appropriate box. For more information, go to IRS.gov/VirtualCurrencyFAQs.

# Question 32

A qualifying syndicate, pool, joint venture, or similar organization may elect under section 761(a) not to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and won't be required to file Form 1065 except for the year of election. If an election out of subchapter K is being made for the tax year, answer “Yes” and attach a statement that contains:

- The names, addresses, and identification numbers of all the members of the organization,
- A statement that the organization qualifies under Regulations section 1.761-2(a), paragraph (1), and either paragraph (2) or (3),
- A statement that all members of the organization elect to exclude the organization from all of subchapter K, and
- A statement indicating the availability of the agreement under which the organization operates (or for an oral agreement, from whom the provisions of the agreement may be obtained).

For calendar-year organizations, Form 1065 must be filed by March 15 following the close of the first calendar year for which the section 761(a) election is being made. The filing date for fiscal-year organizations is the 15th day of the 3rd month following the close of the 1st fiscal year. These dates are subject to filing extensions. See Regulations section 1.761-2 for more information concerning making the election out of subchapter K.

# Question 33

Answer “Yes” if an eligible partnership chooses to elect out of the centralized partnership audit regime for the tax year and enter the total from Schedule B-2, Part III, line 3. If making the election, attach a completed Schedule B-2 to Form 1065. An election out of the centralized partnership audit regime can only be made on a timely filed return (including extensions). A partnership is an eligible partnership for the tax year if it has 100 or fewer eligible partners.

Although the partnership isn't subject to income tax, the partners are liable for tax on their shares of the partnership income.

# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

whether or not distributed, and must include their shares on their tax returns.

If a partner's interest changed during the year (such as the entrance of a new partner, the exit of a partner, an increase to a partner's interest through an additional capital contribution, or a decrease in a partner's interest through a distribution), see section 706(d) and Regulations section 1.706-4 before determining each partner's distributive share of any item of income, gain, loss, and deduction, and other items. Partnership items are allocated to a partner only for the part of the year in which that person is a member of the partnership. Generally, for each change in a partner’s interest, the partnership will either allocate its items using a proration method or a closing-of-the-books method. Special rules apply to certain partnerships, certain variations, and certain items. See Regulations section 1.706-4 for additional rules and procedures for making elections. In addition, special rules in section 706(d)(2) apply to certain items of partnerships that report their income on the cash basis, and special rules in section 706(d)(3) apply to tiered partnerships.

# Schedule K

Schedule K is a summary schedule of all the partners' shares of the partnership's income, credits, deductions, etc. All partnerships must complete Schedule K. Rental activity income (loss) and portfolio income aren't reported on page 1 of Form 1065. These amounts aren't combined with the trade or business activity income (loss) reported on page 1. Schedule K is used to report the totals of these and other amounts reported on page 1.

# Schedule K-1

Schedule K-1 shows each partner's separate share. Attach a copy of each Schedule K-1 to the Form 1065 filed with the IRS. Keep a copy with a copy of the partnership return as a part of the partnership's records and furnish a copy to each partner. If the partner is a DE, furnish the Schedule K-1 to the DE partner. If a partnership interest is held by a nominee on behalf of another person, the partnership may be required to furnish Schedule K-1 to the nominee. See Temporary Regulations sections 1.6031(b)-1T and 1.6031(c)-1T for more information.

Give each partner a copy of either the Partner's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) or specific instructions for each item reported on the partner's Schedule K-1.

# Substitute Forms

The partnership doesn't need IRS approval to use a substitute Schedule K-1 if it's an exact copy of the IRS schedule. The boxes must use the same numbers and titles and must be in the same order and format as on the comparable IRS Schedule K-1. The substitute schedule must include the OMB number. The partnership must provide each partner with the Partner's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) or other prepared specific instructions for each item reported on the partner's Schedule K-1.

The partnership must request IRS approval to use other substitute Schedules K-1. To request approval, write to:

Internal Revenue Service

Attention: Substitute Forms Program

C:DC:TS:CAR:MP:P:TP:TP

ATSC

4800 Buford Highway

Mail Stop 061-N

Chamblee, GA 30341

substituteforms@irs.gov

Each partner's information must be on a separate sheet of paper. Therefore, separate all continuously printed substitutes before you file them with the IRS. The partnership may be subject to a penalty if it files Schedules K-1 that don't conform to the specifications discussed in Pub. 1167, General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms and Schedules.

# How Income Is Shared Among Partners

Allocate shares of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit among the partners according to the partnership agreement for sharing income or loss generally. Partners may agree to allocate specific items in a ratio different from the ratio for sharing income or loss. For instance, if the net income exclusive of specially allocated items is divided evenly among three partners but some special items are allocated 50% to one, 30% to another, and 20% to the third partner, report the specially allocated items on the appropriate line of the applicable partner's Schedule K-1 and the total on the appropriate line of Schedule K, instead of on the numbered lines on page 1 of Form 1065, Form 1125-A, or Schedule D.

However, a foreign partnership that has one or more U.S. partners must file Form 1065. But if it meets each of the following four requirements, it isn't required to file or provide Schedules K-1 for foreign partners (unless the foreign partner is a pass-through entity through which a U.S. person holds an interest in the foreign partnership):

- The partnership had no gross income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States during its tax year.
- The partnership isn't a withholding foreign partnership as defined in Regulations section 1.1441-5(c)(2)(i).
- All required Forms 1042 and 1042-S were filed by the partnership or another withholding agent as required by Regulations sections 1.1461-1(b) and (c).
---
The tax liability for each foreign partner for amounts reportable under Regulations sections 1.1461-1(b) and (c) has been fully satisfied by the withholding of tax at the source. Generally, any person who holds an interest in a partnership as a nominee for another person must furnish to the partnership the name, address, etc., of the other person. If a married couple each had an interest in the partnership, prepare a separate Schedule K-1 for each of them.

# How To Complete Schedule K-1

# Part I. Information About the Partnership

On each Schedule K-1, enter the name, address, and identifying number of the partnership. Item C. If the partnership is filing its return electronically, enter “e-file.” Otherwise, enter the name of the IRS Service Center where the partnership will file its return. See Where To File, earlier.

# Part II. Information About the Partner

In order to enable accurate scanning and processing of Schedule(s) K-1, use a 10-point Helvetica Light Standard font for all entries on Schedules K-1 if the entries are typed or made using a computer. If the return is for a fiscal year or a short tax year, fill in the tax year space at the top of each Schedule K-1. On each Schedule K-1, enter the information about the partnership and the partner in Parts I and II (items A through N). In Part III, enter the partner's distributive share of each item of income, deduction, and credit and any other information the partner needs to file the partner's tax return, including information needed to prepare state and local tax returns.

Codes. In box 11 and boxes 13 through 15, and 17 through 20, identify each item by entering a code in the column to the left of the entry space for the dollar amount. These codes are identified in these instructions and on the List of Codes in the Partner’s Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1065).

Attached statements. When attaching statements to Schedule K-1 to report additional information to the partner, indicate there's a statement for the following:

- If an amount can be input on Schedule K-1 but additional information is required, enter an asterisk (*) after the code in the column to the left of the entry space.
- For items that can't be reported as a single dollar amount, enter the code and an asterisk (*) in the column to the left and enter “STMT” in the right column to indicate that the information is provided on an attached statement.
- If the partnership has more coded items than the number of entry boxes (for example, box 11, boxes 13 through 15, or boxes 17 through 20), don't enter a code or dollar amount in the last entry box. Instead, enter an asterisk (*) in the left column and enter “STMT” in the entry space to the right.

More than one attached statement can be placed on the same sheet of paper. The information included in the statement should be identified in alphanumeric order by box number followed by the letter code (if any), description, and dollar amount for each item. For example: “Box 13, code J—Section 59(e)(2) expenditures—$1,000.” This can be followed with any additional information the partner needs to determine the proper tax treatment of the item.

Section 721(c) partnerships. When the gain deferral method, as described in Regulations section 1.721(c)-3, is being applied, a partnership that is a section 721(c) partnership will attach to the Schedule K-1 provided to a U.S. transferor the information required under Regulations sections 1.721(c)-6(b)(2) and (3). A partnership that is a section 721(c) partnership will also attach to its Form 1065 a Schedule K-1 for each partner that is a related foreign person with respect to the U.S. transferor. For an indirect partner that is a related foreign person with respect to the U.S. transferor, the Schedule K-1 will only include relevant information with respect to section 721(c) property. See Regulations section 1.721(c)-1 for definitions.

For an individual partner, enter the partner's SSN or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) rather than the TIN of the DE partner. For all other partners, enter the partner's EIN. However, if a partner is an IRA, enter the identifying number of the custodian of the IRA. Don't enter the identification number of the person for whom the IRA is maintained. If the partnership reports unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) to such IRA partner, include the IRA partner's unique EIN in box 20, code AR, along with the amount of such income.

Note. For tax year 2024, PTPs aren't required to include the IRA partner’s unique EIN in box 20, code AR. Don’t include dashes when entering the EIN in box 20.

Foreign partners without a U.S. identifying number should be notified by the partnership of the necessity of obtaining a U.S. identifying number. Certain aliens who aren't eligible to obtain SSNs can apply for an ITIN on Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. If the partner in the partnership is an entity, such as a single-member LLC, that is a DE for federal income tax purposes, enter the TIN of the beneficial owner of the DE partner in item E rather than the TIN of the DE partner. The beneficial owner is the taxpayer who owns the DE partner. In item F, enter the name and address of the beneficial owner of the DE partner. See the instructions for item H2 below.

Note. If the partner is an LLC or a trust, the partnership should inquire as to whether the LLC is a DE for federal income tax purposes. If the LLC or trust is a DE, the partnership must verify that the partner's TIN is the TIN used by the partner's beneficial owner in filing its federal income tax return.

Truncating recipient’s TIN on Schedule K-1. The partnership can truncate a partner's identifying number on the Schedule K-1 the partnership sends to the partner. Truncation isn't allowed on the Schedule K-1 the partnership files with the IRS. Also, the partnership can't truncate its own identification number on any form. To truncate, where allowed, replace the first five digits of the nine-digit number with asterisks (*) or Xs (for example, an SSN xxx-xx-xxxx would appear as ***-**-xxxx or XXX-XX-xxxx). For more information, see Regulations section 301.6109-4.

Foreign address. If the partner has a foreign address, enter the information in the following order: city or town, state or province, country, and ZIP or foreign postal code. Follow the country's practice for entering the postal code. Don't abbreviate the country name.
---
# Item G

Complete item G on all Schedules K-1. If a partner holds interests as both a general and limited partner, check both boxes and attach a statement for each activity that shows the amounts allocable to the partner's interest as a limited partner.

# Item H1. Domestic/Foreign Partner

Check the Foreign partner box if the partner is a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, foreign corporation, foreign estate, foreign trust, or foreign government. Otherwise, check the Domestic partner box.

# Item H2. Disregarded Entity (DE)

If the partner is a DE, check the box and provide the name and TIN of the DE partner. The partnership should make reasonable attempts to obtain the DE’s TIN. If after making reasonable attempts to obtain the DE’s TIN such TIN is unavailable or unknown to the partnership, the partnership may report the DE’s TIN as unknown. If the DE doesn't have a TIN, enter “None” in the space for the DE’s TIN. For more information about DE reporting, go to IRS.gov/forms-pubs/clarifications-for-disregarded-entity-reporting-and-section-743b-reporting.

# Item I1. What Type of Entity Is This Partner?

State whether the partner is an individual, a corporation, an estate, a trust, a partnership, a DE, an exempt organization, a foreign government, or a nominee (custodian). If the partner is an LLC and has elected to be treated as other than a DE under Regulations section 301.7701-3 for federal income tax purposes, the partnership must enter the LLC's classification for federal income tax purposes (that is, a corporation or partnership). If any legal owner of the partnership is a DE for federal income tax purposes, report the beneficial owner’s entity type in item I1. If the partner is a nominee, use one of the following codes after the word “nominee” to indicate the type of entity the nominee represents: I—Individual; C—Corporation; F—Estate or Trust; P—Partnership; DE—Disregarded Entity; E—Exempt Organization; IRA—Individual Retirement Arrangement; or FGOV—Foreign Government. If the partner is a nominee that acts on behalf of more than one person, use code M—Multiple.

# Item J. Partner’s Profit, Loss, and Capital

On each line, enter the partner's percentage share of the partnership's profit, loss, and capital as of the beginning and end of the partnership's tax year, as determined under the partnership agreement. If a partner's interest commences after the beginning of the partnership's tax year, enter in the Beginning column the percentages that existed for the partner immediately after admission. If a partner's interest terminates before the end of the partnership's tax year, enter in the Ending column the percentages that existed immediately before termination.

On the line for Capital, enter the percentage share of the capital that the partner would receive if the partnership was liquidated by the distribution of undivided interests in partnership assets and liabilities. If the partner's capital account is negative or zero, express the percentage ownership of capital as zero.

The partner's percentage share of each category must be expressed as a percentage. The percentage must not be negative. The total percentage interest in each category must total 100% for all partners. To determine whether the total beginning and ending percentages are 100%, don't include the beginning percentage for a partner that wasn't a partner at the beginning of the partnership's tax year or the ending percentage for a partner that left the partnership before the end of the partnership's tax year. If the partnership agreement doesn't express the partner's share of profit, loss, and capital as fixed percentages, the partnership may use a reasonable method in arriving at each percentage for purposes of completing the items required by item J, as long as such method is consistent with the partnership agreement and is applied consistently from year to year. Maintain records to support the share of profits, share of losses, and share of capital reported for each partner.

If there is a decrease in the partner's share of profits, losses, or capital, indicate whether it was due to a sale or an exchange.

Sale box. Check the Sale box in this item if there was a taxable sale of all or part of a partnership interest to a new or pre-existing partner during the year, regardless of whether the partner recognized gain or loss on the transaction(s). “Sale,” for the purposes of this checkbox, means a taxable transaction involving the transfer of a partnership interest. This will exclude transfers subject to gain recognition under section 721(b). This will also exclude transactions where a new partnership interest is issued to a partner in exchange for property contributed to the partnership, even if some gain is recognized by the contributing partner.

Exchange box. Check the Exchange box in this item if there was a nontaxable exchange of all or part of a partnership interest to a new or pre-existing partner during the year. “Exchange,” for purposes of this checkbox, means a nontaxable transaction involving the transfer of a partnership interest excluding a transfer on the death of a partner. Exchange also includes a transaction under section 721(a) regardless of whether gain recognition took place.

# Item K1. Partner's Share of Liabilities

Enter each partner's share of nonrecourse liabilities, partnership-level qualified nonrecourse financing, and other recourse liabilities at the end of the year.

Nonrecourse liabilities are those liabilities of the partnership for which no partner (or related person) bears the economic risk of loss. The extent to which a partner bears the economic risk of loss is determined under the rules of Regulations section 1.752-2. Don't include partnership-level qualified nonrecourse financing (defined below) on the line for nonrecourse liabilities.

If the partner terminated their interest in the partnership during the year, enter the share that existed immediately before the total disposition. In all other cases, enter it as of the end of the year.

If the partnership is engaged in two or more different types of at-risk activities, or a combination of at-risk activities and any other activity, attach a statement showing the partner's share of nonrecourse liabilities, partnership-level qualified nonrecourse financing, and other recourse liabilities for each activity. See Pub. 925 to determine if the partnership is engaged in more than one at-risk activity.

The at-risk rules of section 465 generally apply to any activity carried on by the partnership as a trade or business or for the production of income. These rules generally limit the amount of loss and other deductions a partner can claim from any partnership activity to the amount for which that partner is considered at risk. However, for partners who acquired their partnership interests before 1987, the at-risk rules don't apply to losses from an activity of holding real property the partnership placed in service before 1987. The activity of holding mineral property doesn't qualify for this exception. Identify on an attached statement to Schedule K-1 the amount of any losses that aren't subject to the at-risk rules.

If a partnership is engaged in an activity subject to the limitations of section 465(c)(1) (such as films or videotapes, leasing section 1245 property, farming, or oil and gas property), give each partner their share of the total pre-1976 losses from that activity for which there existed a corresponding amount of
---
# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

nonrecourse liability at the end of each year in which the losses occurred. See Form 6198, At-Risk Limitations, and related instructions for more information.

Qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property used in an activity of holding real property that is subject to the at-risk rules is treated as an amount at risk. Qualified nonrecourse financing generally includes financing for which no one is personally liable for repayment that is borrowed for use in an activity of holding real property and that is loaned or guaranteed by a federal, state, or local government or that is borrowed from a qualified person. Qualified persons include any person actively and regularly engaged in the business of lending money, such as a bank or savings and loan association. Qualified persons generally don't include related parties (unless the nonrecourse financing is commercially reasonable and on substantially the same terms as loans involving unrelated persons), the seller of the property, or a person who receives a fee for the partnership's investment in the real property. See section 465(b)(6) for more information on qualified nonrecourse financing.

The partner as well as the partnership must meet the qualified nonrecourse rules. Therefore, the partnership must enter on an attached statement any other information the partner needs to determine if the qualified nonrecourse rules are also met at the partner level.

# Item K2

If a partnership (upper-tier) owns a direct interest in other partnerships (lower-tier), then Regulations section 1.752-4(a) requires that the upper-tier partnership allocate to its partners its share of the lower-tier partnership's liabilities (except for any liability of the lower-tier partnership that is owed to the upper-tier partnership). Allocate those lower-tier partnership liabilities to each partner based on whether that liability is a recourse or nonrecourse liability to the partner under the regulations under section 752. The characterization of a liability may change as it moves from a lower-tier partnership to an upper-tier partnership. If Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) includes lower-tier partnership liabilities, check the box in item K2. If the total liabilities on all Schedules K-1 (Form 1065) don't equal the total liabilities on Schedule L, attach a reconciliation.

# Item K3. Payment Obligations Including Guarantees and Deficit Restoration Obligations (DROs)

Check the box in item K3 if the partner or a related person has certain payment obligations, including guarantees or DROs, with respect to any liability in item K1. See the instructions for line 20c, code X, for additional information. For purposes of item K3, a payment obligation is defined as an obligation under Regulations section 1.752-2(b)(1) that is recognized under Regulations sections 1.752-2(b)(3)(i)(A) and (B) (such as a recognized guarantee or an obligation to restore a deficit capital account upon liquidation), and a related person is defined as a related person as defined in Regulations section 1.752-4(b).

# Item L. Partner's Capital Account Analysis

You aren’t required to complete item L if the answer to question 4 of Schedule B is “Yes.” If you're required to complete this item, also see the instructions for Schedule M-2, later.

Tax-basis method. Figure each partner's capital account for the partnership's tax year using the transactional approach, discussed below, for the tax-basis method.

How to report partnership events or transactions. If you're uncertain how to report a partnership event or transaction, you should account for the event or transaction in a manner generally consistent with figuring the partner's adjusted tax basis in its partnership interest (without regard to partnership liabilities), taking into account the rules and principles of sections 705, 722, 733, and 742 and by reporting the amount on the line for other increase (decrease). The partner's ending capital account as reported using the tax-basis method in item L might not equal the partner's adjusted tax basis in its partnership interest. Generally, this is because a partner's adjusted tax basis in its partnership interest includes the partner's share of partnership liabilities, as well as partner-specific adjustments. Each partner is responsible for maintaining a record of the adjusted tax basis in its partnership interest.

Beginning capital account. Enter the partner's ending capital account as determined for last year on the line for beginning capital account. If a partner joined the partnership through a contribution to the partnership this year, enter zero as the partner's beginning capital account.

Capital contributed during the year. On the line for capital contributed during the year, enter the amount of cash plus the adjusted tax basis of all property contributed by the partner to the partnership during the year. The amount you enter on this line should be reduced by any liabilities assumed by the partnership in connection with, or liabilities to which the property is subject immediately before, the contribution. This amount might be negative.

Current year net income (loss). On the line for current year net income (loss), enter the partner's distributive share of partnership income and gain (including tax-exempt income) as figured for tax purposes for the year, minus the partner's distributive share of partnership loss and deductions (including nondeductible, noncapital expenditures) as figured for tax purposes for the year.

Other increase (decrease). On the line for other increase (decrease), enter the sum of all other increases or decreases that affected the partner's capital account for tax purposes during the year and attach a statement explaining each adjustment. For example, if a new partner acquired its interest in the partnership from another partner in a purchase, exchange, gift, or inheritance, enter an amount for the transferee under other increase that is equal to the transferor partner's ending capital account with respect to the interest transferred immediately before the transfer figured using the tax-basis method. Other examples of increases include the following.

- The partner's distributive share of the excess of the tax deductions for depletion (other than oil and gas depletion) over the adjusted tax basis of the property subject to depletion.
- The partner's share of any increase to the adjusted tax basis of partnership property under section 734(b).

If a transferor partner disposed of its interest in the partnership by sale, exchange, or gift, or as the result of death, enter the transferor partner's ending capital account with respect to the interest transferred immediately before the transfer figured using the tax-basis method. Other examples of decreases include the following.

- The partner's distributive share of tax deductions for depletion of any partnership oil and gas property, but not exceeding the partner's share of the adjusted tax basis of that property.
- The partner's share of any decrease to the adjusted tax basis of partnership property under section 734(b).

Note. Section 743(b) basis adjustments aren't taken into account in calculating a partner's capital account under the tax-basis method.

Withdrawals and distributions. On the line for withdrawals and distributions, enter the amount of cash plus the adjusted tax basis of all property distributed by the partnership to the partner during the year. The amount you enter on this line should be reduced by any liabilities assumed by the partner in connection with, or liabilities to which the property is subject immediately before, the distribution. This amount might be negative.
---
# Ending capital account

The sum of the amounts shown on all unrecognized section 704(c) gain or loss in partnership property, including section 704(c) gain or loss arising from revaluations of partnership property. See Notice 2019-66 for more information.

A partner's ending capital account determined under the tax-basis method may be negative if the sum of a partner's losses and distributions exceeds the sum of the partner's contributions and share of income.

# Publicly traded partnerships (PTPs)

In the case of a sale or exchange of an interest in a PTP, you may determine a transferee partner's beginning capital account by adjusting the partner's beginning capital account to reflect the transferee partner's purchase price of the interest rather than entering the transferor partner's ending capital account. In making the adjustments, you may use information required to be reported to you under Temporary Regulations section 1.6031(c)-1T, and publicly available trading price information.

# Item M. Did the Partner Contribute Property With a Built-in Gain or Loss?

Check the appropriate box to indicate whether the partner contributed property with a built-in gain or loss during the tax year. If “Yes,” attach a statement that contains the following information:

- A description of each property the partner contributed.
- The date the property was contributed.
- The amount of the property's built-in gain or loss.

Exception. If a partner contributes more than 10 properties with either a built-in gain or built-in loss on any date during the tax year, the partnership isn't required to provide the required information separately for each property contributed for that date. Instead, the partnership can report the (a) number of properties contributed on that date, (b) total amount of built-in gain, and (c) total amount of built-in loss. Don't net the built-in gains and built-in losses; instead, show the total built-in gain and total built-in loss for all properties contributed on that date.

# Income (Loss)

# Line 1. Ordinary Business Income (Loss)

Enter the amount from page 1, line 23. Enter the income (loss) without reference to (a) the bases of the partners' interests in the partnership, (b) the partners' at-risk limitations, or (c) the passive activity limitations. These limitations, if applicable, are determined at the partner level.

Line 1 shouldn't include rental activity income (loss) or portfolio income (loss).

# Schedule K-1

Enter each partner's distributive share of ordinary business income (loss) in box 1 of Schedule K-1. Identify on statements attached to Schedule K-1 any additional information the partner needs to correctly apply the passive activity limitations. For example, if the partnership has more than one trade or business activity, identify on an attached statement to Schedule K-1 the amount from each separate activity. See Passive Activity Reporting Requirements, earlier.

# Line 2. Net Rental Real Estate Income (Loss)

Enter the net income (loss) from rental real estate activities of the partnership from Form 8825. Attach this form to Form 1065.

Schedule K-1. Enter each partner's distributive share of net rental real estate income (loss) in box 2 of Schedule K-1. Identify on statements attached to Schedule K-1 any additional information the partner needs to correctly apply the passive activity limitations. For example, if the partnership has more than one rental real estate activity, identify the amount attributable to each activity. Also, for example, identify certain items from any rental real estate activities that may be subject to the recharacterization rules. See Passive Activity Reporting Requirements, earlier.

# Item N. Partner's Share of Net Unrecognized Section 704(c) Gain or (Loss)

For item N, the partnership should report the partner's share of net unrecognized section 704(c) gains or losses, both at the beginning and at the end of the partnership's tax year. Solely for purposes of completing item N, the section 704(c) gain or loss is the partner's share of the net (net means aggregate or sum) of.

Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

# Line 3. Other Net Rental Income (Loss)

Interest expense allocable to portfolio income is generally investment interest expense reported on Schedule K, line 13c.

Enter on line 3a gross income from rental activities other than those reported on Form 8825. Include on line 3a gain (loss) from Form 4797, line 17, that is attributable to the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of an asset used in a rental activity other than a rental real estate activity.

Enter on line 3b the deductible expenses of the activity. Attach a statement of these expenses to Form 1065.

Enter on line 3c the net income (loss).

See Rental Activities, earlier, and Pub. 925 for more information on rental activities.

# Schedule K-1

Enter each partner's distributive share of net income (loss) from rental activities other than rental real estate activities in box 3 of Schedule K-1. Identify on statements attached to Schedule K-1 any additional information the partner needs to correctly apply the passive activity limitations. For example, if the partnership has more than one rental activity reported in box 3, identify on an attached statement to Schedule K-1 the amount from each activity. See Passive Activity Reporting Requirements, earlier.

# Line 5. Interest Income

Enter only taxable portfolio interest on this line. Taxable interest is interest from all sources except interest exempt from tax and interest on tax-free covenant bonds. Include interest income from the credit to holders of tax credit bonds. See the instructions for codes AP through AU under Line 15f. Other Credits, later, and the Instructions for Form 8912, Credit to Holders of Tax Credit Bonds, for details.

# Schedule K-1

Enter each partner's distributive share of interest income in box 5 of Schedule K-1. If the partnership is reporting interest income from clean renewable energy bonds, attach a statement to Schedule K-1 that shows each partner's distributive share of interest income from this credit. Partners need this information to properly adjust the bases of their interests in the partnership.

# Line 6a. Ordinary Dividends

Enter only taxable ordinary dividends on line 6a, including any qualified dividends reported on line 6b. Don't include any dividend equivalents reported on line 6c, or, to the extent attributable to previously taxed earnings and profits (PTEP) in annual PTEP accounts of the partnership, any distributions received by the partnership from foreign corporations.

Note. The amount determined by the partnership based on its annual PTEP accounts in determining the amount on line 6a doesn't include the amount by which distributions are attributable to PTEP in annual PTEP accounts of a direct or indirect partner.

# Schedule K-1

Enter each partner's distributive share of ordinary dividends in box 6a of Schedule K-1.

# Line 6b. Qualified Dividends

Enter qualified dividends on line 6b. Except as provided below, qualified dividends are dividends received from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. Don't include any distributions received by the partnership from foreign corporations to the extent that they are attributable to PTEP in annual PTEP accounts of the partnership.

Note. The amount determined by the partnership based on its annual PTEP accounts in determining the amount on line 6b doesn't include the amount by which distributions are attributable to PTEP in annual PTEP accounts of a direct or indirect partner.

# Exceptions

The following dividends aren't qualified dividends:

- Dividends the partnership received on any share of stock held for less than 61 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. When determining the number of days the partnership held the stock, don't count certain days during which the partnership's risk of loss was diminished. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the purchaser of a stock isn't entitled to receive the next dividend payment. When counting the number of days the partnership held the stock, include the day the partnership disposed of the stock but not the day the partnership acquired it.
- Dividends attributable to periods totaling more than 366 days that the partnership received on any share of preferred stock held for less than 91 days during the 181-day period that began.

# Portfolio Income

See Portfolio Income, earlier, for a definition of portfolio income. Don't reduce portfolio income by deductions allocated to it. Report such deductions (other than interest expense) on Schedule K, line 13e. Report each partner's distributive share of deductions (other than interest) allocable to portfolio income in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code I or L.
---
90 days before the ex-dividend date. When determining the number of days the partnership held the stock, don't count certain days during which the partnership's risk of loss was diminished. Preferred dividends attributable to periods totaling less than 367 days are subject to the 61-day holding period rule above.

- Dividends that relate to payments that the partnership is obligated to make because of short sales or positions in substantially similar or related property.
- Dividends paid by a RIC that aren't treated as qualified dividend income under section 854.
- Dividends paid by a REIT that aren't treated as qualified dividend income under section 857(c).
- Dividends from a corporation which first became a surrogate.

Schedule K-1. Enter each partner's distributive share of royalties in box 7 of Schedule K-1.

# Line 9a. Net Long-Term Capital Gain (Loss)

Enter the gain or loss that is portfolio income (loss) from Schedule D (Form 1065), line 15. Schedule K-1. Enter each partner's distributive share of net long-term capital gain (loss) in box 9a of Schedule K-1.

Qualified foreign corporation. A foreign corporation is a qualified foreign corporation if it's:

1. Incorporated in a territory of the United States, or
2. Eligible for benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the Secretary determines is satisfactory for this purpose and that includes an exchange of information program. See Notice 2011-64, 2011-37 I.R.B. 231, for details.

If the foreign corporation doesn't meet either (1) or (2) above, then it may be treated as a qualified foreign corporation for any dividend paid by the corporation if the stock associated with the dividend paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States.

However, qualified dividends don't include dividends paid by an entity that was a PFIC (defined in section 1297) in either the tax year of the distribution or the preceding tax year. See Notice 2004-71, 2004-45 I.R.B. 793, for more details.

Schedule K-1. Enter each partner's distributive share of qualified dividends in box 6b of Schedule K-1.

Attach a statement to the Schedule K-1 identifying the dividends included in box 6a or 6b that are eligible for the deduction for dividends received under section 243(a), (b), or (c); section 245; or section 245A; or are hybrid dividends as defined in section 245A(e)(4).

# Line 9b. Collectibles (28%) Gain (Loss)

Figure the amount attributable to collectibles from the amount reported on Schedule D (Form 1065), line 15. A collectibles gain (loss) is any long-term gain or deductible long-term loss from the sale or exchange of a collectible that is a capital asset.

Collectibles include works of art, rugs, antiques, metal (such as gold, silver, or platinum bullion), gems, stamps, coins, alcoholic beverages, and certain other tangible property.

Also, include gain (but not loss) from the sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership or trust held for more than 1 year and attributable to unrealized appreciation of collectibles. For details, see Regulations section 1.1(h)-1. Also attach the statement required under Regulations section 1.1(h)-1(e).

Schedule K-1. Report each partner's distributive share of the collectibles (28%) gain (loss) in box 9b of Schedule K-1.

# Line 9c. Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain

The three types of unrecaptured section 1250 gain must be reported separately on an attached statement to Form 1065. From the sale or exchange of the partnership's business assets. Figure this amount in Form 4797, Part III, for each section 1250 property (except property for which gain is reported using the installment method on Form 6252) for which you had an entry in Form 4797, Part I. Subtract Form 4797, Part III, line 26g, from the smaller of Form 4797, line 22 or line 24. Figure the total of these amounts for all section 1250 properties.

Generally, the result is the partnership's unrecaptured section 1250 gain. However, if the partnership is reporting gain on the installment method for a section 1250 property held more than 1 year, see the next paragraph.

# Line 6c. Dividend Equivalents

Information on dividend equivalents, as described in section 871(m), is provided for persons that aren't U.S. persons, who are generally required to treat dividend equivalents as U.S. source dividends, and domestic partnerships with partners who may need this information. Enter the amount of dividend equivalents as defined in section 871(m). See Regulations section 1.871-15 for additional information. For purposes of line 6c, include all amounts that would be included as a dividend equivalent if the amount were paid to a person subject to tax under section 871 or 881, even if the partner is a U.S. person.

# Line 7. Royalties

Enter the royalties received by the partnership.

Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)
---
The total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for an installment sale of section 1250 property held more than 1 year is figured in a manner similar to that used in the preceding paragraph. However, the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain must be allocated to the installment payments received from the sale. To do so, the partnership must generally treat the gain allocable to each installment payment as unrecaptured section 1250 gain until all such gain has been used in full. Figure the unrecaptured section 1250 gain for installment payments received during the tax year as the smaller of (a) the amount from Form 6252, Part II, line 26, or Part III, line 37 (whichever applies); or (b) the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain for the sale reduced by all gain reported in prior years (excluding section 1250 ordinary income recapture).

If the partnership chose not to treat all of the gain from payments received after May 6, 1997, and before August 24, 1999, as unrecaptured section 1250 gain, use only the amount the partnership chose to treat as unrecaptured section 1250 gain for those payments to reduce the total unrecaptured section 1250 gain remaining to be reported for the sale. See Regulations section 1.453-12.

# Line 11. Other Income (Loss)

Enter any other item of income or loss not included on lines 1 through 10. Determine other income (loss) without regard to any amount reported on line 6c. On the line to the left of the entry space for line 11, identify the type of income. If there's more than one type of income, attach a statement to Form 1065 that separately identifies each type and amount of income for each of the following categories. The codes needed for Schedule K-1 reporting are provided in the heading for each category below.

Other portfolio income (loss) (code A). Portfolio income not reported on lines 5 through 10. Report and identify other portfolio income or loss on an attached statement for line 11. For example, income reported to the partnership from a REMIC, in which the partnership is a residual interest holder, would be reported on an attached statement for line 11. If the partnership holds a residual interest in a REMIC, report on the attached statement for box 11 of Schedule K-1 the partner's share of the following.

- Taxable income (net loss) from the REMIC (Schedules Q (Form 1066), line 1b).
- Excess inclusion (Schedules Q (Form 1066), line 2c).
- Section 212 expenses (Schedules Q (Form 1066), line 3b).

Don't report these section 212 expense deductions related to portfolio income on Schedules K and K-1. Because Schedule Q (Form 1066) is a quarterly statement, the partnership must follow the Schedule Q instructions to figure the amounts to report to partners for the partnership's tax year.

Schedule K-1. Report each partner's distributive share of unrecaptured section 1250 gain from the sale or exchange of the business assets in box 9c of Schedule K-1. If the partnership is reporting unrecaptured section 1250 gain from an estate, a trust, a REIT, or a RIC, or from the partnership's sale or exchange of an interest in another partnership (as explained above), enter “STMT” in box 9c and an asterisk (*) in the left column of the box, and attach a statement that separately identifies the amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain from the following.

Attach a statement to Schedule K-1 that shows the following.

- The partner's distributive share of the amount of the charitable contributions made under section 170(e)(3) for qualified inventory that was donated to charitable organizations for the care of the ill, needy, and infants. The food must meet all the quality and labeling standards imposed by federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The amount of the charitable contribution for donated food inventory is the lesser of (a) the basis of the donated food plus one-half of the appreciation (gain if the donated food was sold at FMV on the date of the gift), or (b) twice the amount of basis of the donated food. A partnership that doesn't account for inventories and isn't required to capitalize indirect costs under section 263A may elect to treat the basis of the donated food as equal to 25% of the FMV of the food. See section 170(e)(3)(C) for more details.
- The partner's distributive share of the net income for the tax year from the partnership's trades or businesses that made the contribution of food inventory.

Don’t include the amount of food inventory contributions in the amount reported in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code C. These contributions must be reported separately on an attached statement because partners must separately determine the limitations on the deduction.

# Contributions of property

See Contributions of Property in Pub. 526, and Pub. 561, Determining the Value of Donated Property, for information on noncash contributions and contributions of capital gain property. If the deduction claimed for noncash contributions exceeds $500, complete Form 8283 and attach it to Form 1065.

If the partnership made a qualified conservation contribution under section 170(h), also include the FMV of the underlying property before and after the donation, as well as the type of legal interest contributed, and describe the conservation purpose furthered by the donation. Give a copy of this information to each partner.

If the partnership made a qualified conservation contribution for the preservation of a historic structure, there are additional requirements that may apply to obtain a charitable contribution deduction. This deduction may be reduced if rehabilitation credits were claimed for the historic structure. This deduction may be denied if the partnership doesn't comply with section 170(f)(19). A $500 filing fee may apply to certain deductions over $10,000. See the Instructions for Form 8283 and Pub. 526 for details.

Subject to three exceptions, a charitable contribution by a partnership (whether made directly or reported as an allocated portion of a contribution of another partnership) isn't treated as a qualified conservation contribution if the amount of such contribution exceeds 2.5 times the sum of each ultimate member's relevant basis (disallowance rule). See the Instructions for Form 8283, Pub. 526, and Regulations sections 1.170A-14(j) through (n) for more details and information on the three exceptions.

An “ultimate member” means, with respect to any partnership, any partner (that is not itself a partnership or S corporation) or S corporation shareholder that receives a distributive share or pro rata share, directly or indirectly, of a qualified conservation contribution. Thus, a partnership's ultimate members will be partners holding a direct interest in the partnership, partners holding an interest in an upper-tier partnership, or shareholders in an upper-tier S corporation. An upper-tier partnership or upper-tier S corporation is a partnership or S corporation that doesn’t itself make the contribution, but instead receives an allocated portion of a qualified conservation contribution from another partnership.

If the disallowance rule doesn’t apply to the contributing partnership because the amount of the contributing partnership's qualified conservation contribution is equal to or less than 2.5 times the sum of each ultimate member's relevant basis, then any upper-tier partnership must still determine whether the disallowance rule applies to its allocated portion of the qualified conservation contribution. Subject to the three exceptions, if an upper-tier partnership's allocated portion exceeds 2.5 times the sum of each ultimate member's relevant basis, the contribution isn’t treated as a qualified conservation contribution with respect to the upper-tier partnership, any subsequent upper-tier partnership or upper-tier S corporation, or any ultimate member. No one may claim a deduction for the allocated portion attributable to that upper-tier partnership.

If an upper-tier partnership's allocated portion is equal to or less than 2.5 times the sum of each ultimate member's relevant basis, then any subsequent upper-tier partnership or upper-tier S corporation must still determine whether the disallowance rule applies to its allocated portion.

In an attachment to each Schedule K-1 issued to a partner that is an ultimate member, report the partner’s relevant basis. If the Schedule K-1 is being issued to a partner that’s an upper-tier partnership or upper-tier S corporation, the attachment should include a list of the relevant basis of each ultimate member of the upper-tier partnership or upper-tier S corporation. The partnership should coordinate with each partner in calculating relevant basis. See Qualified Conservation Contribution in Pub. 526 and Disallowance of deduction for certain qualified conservation contributions by partnerships and S corporations in the Instructions for Form 8283.

# Nondeductible contributions

Certain contributions made to an organization conducting lobbying activities aren't deductible. See section 170(f)(9) for more details. Also, see Contributions You Can’t Deduct in Pub. 526 for more examples of nondeductible contributions.

# Contributions (100%) (code G)

Use code G to report the contributions below and, on an attached statement, provide the following information.

- Qualified conservation contributions of property used in agriculture or livestock production. Enter qualified conservation contributions of property used in agriculture or livestock production.

- If the partnership is a qualified farmer or rancher (as defined in section 170(b)(1)(E)(v)), show each partner's distributive share of qualified conservation contributions of property used in agriculture or livestock production. Partners will have to separately determine whether they qualify for the 50% or 100% AGI limitation for these contributions. Don't include the amounts reported on the attached statement using code G in the amount reported on Schedule K-1 for qualified conservation contributions using code C.

# Line 13c. Investment Interest Expense (Code H)

Include on this line the interest properly allocable to debt on property held for investment purposes. Property held for investment includes property that produces income from interest, dividends, annuities, or royalties not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Property held for investment also includes property that produces gains not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business from the disposition of property that produces those types of income or is held for investment.

Investment interest expense doesn't include interest expense allocable to a passive activity. Investment income and investment expenses other than interest are reported on lines 20a and 20b, respectively. This information is needed by partners to determine the investment interest expense limitation (see Form 4952 for details).

# Schedule K-1

Report each partner's distributive share of investment interest expense in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code H.

# Lines 13d(1) and 13d(2). Section 59(e)(2) Expenditures (Code J)

Generally, section 59(e) allows each partner to make an election to deduct their distributive share of the partnership's otherwise deductible qualified expenditures ratably over 10 years (3 years for circulation expenditures). The deduction is taken beginning with the tax year in which the expenditures were made (or for intangible drilling and development costs, over the 60-month period beginning with the month in which such costs were paid or incurred). The term “qualified expenditures” includes only the following types of expenditures paid or incurred during the tax year:

- Circulation expenditures.
- R&E expenditures.
- Intangible drilling and development costs.
- Mining exploration and development costs.

If a partner makes the election, these items aren't treated as alternative minimum tax (AMT) tax preference items. Because the partners are generally allowed to make this election, the partnership can't deduct these amounts or include them as AMT items on Schedule K-1. Instead, the partnership passes through the information the partners need to figure their separate deductions. On line 13d(1), enter the type of expenditures claimed on line 13d(2). Enter on line 13d(2) the qualified expenditures paid or incurred during the tax year for which an election under section 59(e) may apply. Enter this amount for all partners whether or not any partner makes an election under section 59(e).

# Line 13e. Other Deductions

Enter deductions not included on lines 12, 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d(2), and 21. On the line to the left of the entry space for this line, identify the type of deduction. If there's more than one type of deduction, attach a statement to Form 1065 that separately identifies the type and amount of each deduction for the following categories. The codes needed for Schedule K-1 reporting are provided for each category.

Deductions—royalty income (code I). Enter deductions related to royalty income.

Excess business interest expense (EBIE) (code K). If the partnership is required to file Form 8990, it may determine it has EBIE. If so, enter the amount from Form 8990, Part II, line 32, for EBIE.

Schedule K-1. Provide the information each partner needs to figure EBIE. In box 13, report the partner’s distributive share of EBIE. If the partnership reports EBIE, the partner is required to file Form 8990. The partner will enter the amount in Form 8990, Schedule A, line 43, column (c). See the Instructions for Form 8990 for additional information.

Deductions—portfolio income (other) (code L). Enter any other deductions related to portfolio income.

No deduction is allowed under section 212 for expenses allocable to a convention, seminar, or similar meeting. Because these expenses aren't deductible by partners, the partnership doesn't report these expenses on Schedule K, line 13e. The expenses are nondeductible and are reported as such on Schedule K, line 18c, and in box 18 of Schedule K-1 using code C.

Schedule K-1. In box 13, report the partner's distributive share of deductions related to portfolio income that are reported on Schedule K, line 13e, using code I (for deductions related to royalty income) or L (for other deductions related to portfolio income).

If a qualified plan is a defined benefit plan, a partner's distributive share of payments is determined in the same manner as the partner’s distributive share of partnership taxable income. For a defined benefit plan, attach to the Schedule K-1 for each partner a statement showing the amount of benefit accrued for the tax year.

# Reforestation expense deduction (code S)

The partnership can elect to deduct a limited amount of its reforestation expenditures paid or incurred during the tax year. The amount the partnership can elect to deduct is limited to $10,000 for each qualified timber property. See section 194(c) for a definition of reforestation expenditures and qualified timber property. The partnership must amortize over 84 months any amount not deducted. See the instructions for Form 1065, page 1, line 21, earlier. See Notice 2006-47, 2006-20 I.R.B. 892, for details on making the election.

# Schedule K-1

Enter the partner's distributive share of the allowable reforestation expenses in box 13 of Schedule K-1 using code S, and attach a statement that provides a description of the qualified timber property. If the partnership is electing to deduct amounts from more than one qualified timber property, provide a description and the amount for each property.

# Deductions—portfolio income (code AE)

Enter the amount of deductions related to portfolio income which were formerly deductible by individuals under section 67 subject to the 2% AGI floor. For partners other than individuals, amounts that are clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income (other than investment interest expense and section 212 expenses from a REMIC) can be deducted on those partners’ income tax returns.

# Other (code ZZ)

Any other information the partners need to prepare their tax returns.

# Soil and water conservation (code W)

Enter amounts for soil and water conservation expenditures, and endangered species recovery expenditures. See section 175.

# Film, television, and theatrical production expenses (code X)

The partnership can elect to deduct certain costs of a qualified film, television, or live theatrical production commencing before January 1, 2026 (after December 31, 2015, and before January 1, 2026, for a live theatrical production), limited to $15 million of the aggregate production cost of the production. There's a higher dollar limitation for productions in certain areas. Provide a description of the film, television, or live theatrical production on an attached statement. If the partnership makes the election for more than one film, television, or live theatrical production, attach a statement to Schedule K-1 that.

# Self-Employment

If the partnership is an options dealer or a commodities dealer, see section 1402(i) before completing lines 14a, 14b, and 14c, to determine the amount of any adjustment that may have to be made to the amounts shown on the Worksheet for Figuring Net Earnings (Loss) From Self-Employment, later. If the partnership is engaged solely in the operation of a group investment program, earnings from the operation generally aren't self-employment earnings for either general or limited partners.
---
# General partners

General partners' net earnings (loss) from self-employment don't include the following:

- Dividends on any shares of stock and interest on any bonds, debentures, notes, etc., unless the dividends or interest are received in the course of a trade or business, such as a dealer in stocks or securities or interest on notes or accounts receivable.
- Rentals from real estate, except rentals of real estate held for sale to customers in the course of a trade or business as a real estate dealer or payments for rooms or space when significant services are provided.
- Royalty income, except royalty income received in the course of a trade or business.

See the Instructions for Schedule SE (Form 1040) for more information.

# Limited partners

Generally, a limited partner's share of partnership income (loss) isn't included in net earnings (loss) from self-employment. Limited partners treat as self-employment earnings only guaranteed payments for services they actually rendered to, or on behalf of, the partnership to the extent that those payments are payment for those services.

However, whether a partner qualifies as a limited partner for purposes of self-employment tax depends on whether the partner is considered a limited partner under section 1402(a)(13).

# Line 14a. Net Earnings (Loss) From Self-Employment (Code A)

• Rentals of real estate held for sale to customers in the course of a trade or business as a real estate dealer, or

• Rentals for which services were rendered to the occupants (other than services usually or customarily rendered for the rental of space for occupancy only). The supplying of maid service is such a service, but the furnishing of heat and light; the cleaning of public entrances, exits, stairways, and lobbies; and trash collection, etc., aren't considered services rendered to the occupants.

# Line 3c

The distributive share of limited partners isn't earnings from self-employment and isn't reported on this line.

# Lines 3b and 4b

Allocate the amounts on these lines in the same way Form 1065, page 1, line 23, is allocated to these particular partners.

# Line 4a

Include in the amount on line 4a any guaranteed payments to partners reported on Schedule K, line 4c, and in box 4c of Schedule K-1, and derived from a trade or business as defined in section 1402(c). Also include other ordinary business income and expense items (other than expense items subject to separate limitations at the partner level, such as the section 179 expense deduction) reported on Schedules K and K-1 that are used to figure self-employment earnings under section 1402.

# Line 4c

Guaranteed payments to general partners and limited partners for services provided to the partnership are net earnings from self-employment and are reported on this line.

# Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Items

For property placed in service before 1999, refigure depreciation for the AMT as follows (using the same convention used for the regular tax).

- For section 1250 property (generally, residential rental and nonresidential real property), use the straight line method over 40 years.
- For tangible property (other than section 1250 property) depreciated using the straight line method for the regular tax, use the straight line method over the property's class life. Use 12 years if the property has no class life.
- For any other tangible property, use the 150% declining balance method, switching to the straight line method the first tax year it gives a larger deduction, over the property's AMT class life. Use 12 years if the property has no class life.

See Pub. 946 for a table of class lives.

TIP: For property (except section 1250 property) placed in service after 1998, refigure depreciation for the AMT only for property depreciated for the regular tax using the 200% declining balance method. For the AMT, use the 150% declining balance method, switching to the straight line method the first tax year it gives a larger deduction, and the same convention and recovery period used for the regular tax. For section 1250 property, refigure depreciation for the AMT using the straight line method, and the same convention and recovery period used for regular tax.

Lines 17a through 17f must be completed for all partners.

Enter items of income and deductions that are adjustments or tax preference items for the AMT. See Form 6251, Alternative Minimum Tax—Individuals; or Schedule I (Form 1041), Alternative Minimum Tax—Estates and Trusts, to determine the amounts to enter and for other information.

Don't include as a tax preference item any qualified expenditures to which an election under section 59(e) may apply. Instead, report these expenditures on Schedule K, line 13d(2). Because these expenditures are subject to an election by each partner, the partnership can't figure the amount of any tax preference related to them. Instead, the partnership must pass through to each partner in box 13, code J, of Schedule K-1 the information needed to figure the deduction.

# Schedule K-1

Report each partner's distributive share of amounts reported on lines 17a through 17f (concerning AMT) in box 17 of Schedule K-1 using codes A through F, respectively. If the partnership is reporting items of income or deduction for oil, gas, and geothermal properties, you may be required to identify these items on a statement attached to Schedule K-1 (see Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Properties Gross Income and Deductions, later, for details). Also see the requirement for an attached statement in the instructions for line 17f.

# Line 17a. Post-1986 Depreciation Adjustment (Code A)

Figure the adjustment for line 17a based only on tangible property placed in service after 1986 (and tangible property placed in service after July 31, 1986, and before 1987 for which the partnership elected to use the General Depreciation System). Don't make an adjustment for motion picture films, videotapes, sound recordings, certain public utility property (as defined in section 168(f)(2)), property depreciated under the unit-of-production method (or any other method not expressed in a term of years), qualified Indian reservation property, property eligible for a special depreciation allowance, qualified revitalization expenditures, or the section 179 expense deduction.

Figure the adjustment by subtracting the AMT deduction for depreciation from the regular tax deduction and enter the result on line 17a. If the AMT deduction is more than the regular tax deduction, enter the difference as a negative amount. Depreciation capitalized to inventory must also be refigured using the AMT rules. Include on this line the current year adjustment to income, if any, resulting from the difference.

# Line 17b. Adjusted Gain or Loss (Code B)

If the partnership disposed of any tangible property placed in service after 1986 (or after July 31, 1986, if an election was made to use the General Depreciation System), or if it disposed of a certified pollution control facility placed in service after 1986, refigure the gain or loss from the disposition using the adjusted basis for the AMT. The property's adjusted basis for the AMT is its cost or other basis minus all depreciation or amortization deductions allowed or allowable for the AMT during the current tax year and previous tax years. Enter on this line the difference between the regular tax gain (loss) and the AMT gain (loss). If the AMT gain is less than the regular tax gain, or the AMT loss is more than the regular tax loss, or there's an AMT loss and a regular tax gain, enter the difference as a negative amount.

If any part of the adjustment is allocable to net short-term capital gain (loss), net long-term capital gain (loss), or net section 1231 gain (loss), attach a statement that identifies the amount of the adjustment allocable to each type of gain or loss. For a net long-term capital gain (loss), also identify the amount of the adjustment that is collectibles (28%) gain (loss). For a net section 1231 gain (loss), also identify the amount of adjustment that is unrecaptured section 1250 gain.

# Line 17c. Depletion (Other Than Oil and Gas) (Code C)

Don't include any depletion on oil and gas wells. The partners must figure their oil and gas depletion deductions and preference items separately under section 613A.
---
# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

Refigure the depletion deduction under section 611 for mines, wells (other than oil and gas wells), and other natural deposits for the AMT. Percentage depletion is limited to 50% of the taxable income from the property as figured under section 613(a), using only income and deductions for the AMT. Also, the deduction is limited to the property's adjusted basis at the end of the year as figured for the AMT. Figure this limit separately for each property. When refiguring the property's adjusted basis, take into account any AMT adjustments made this year or in previous years that affect basis (other than the current year's depletion).

Enter the difference between the regular tax and AMT deduction. If the AMT deduction is greater, enter the difference as a negative amount.

# Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Properties—Gross Income and Deductions

# Examples

The following examples assume that the described partnership liabilities are properly allocable to the partner in the examples under the rules of section 752.

# Example 1

In Year 1, a partnership borrows $1,000 (PS Liability 1) from Bank 1 and $1,000 (PS Liability 2) from Bank 2. A partner guarantees payment of up to $500 of PS Liability 1 if any amount of the full $1,000 isn't recovered by Bank 1 and lends $200 to the partnership, and a person related to the partner guarantees payment of the entire amount of PS Liability 2 of $1,000. The partnership enters $1,700 as the ending balance of the partner's share of recourse liabilities in item K1 of the Schedule K-1 for tax Year 1. For tax Year 1, the partnership would enter $1,500 in box 20 under code X as the aggregate ending balance of the partner's or related person's payment obligations. On the attached statement, the partnership would separately identify each of the partner's or related person's payment obligations (for example, $500 with respect to the partner's guarantee of PS Liability 1 and $1,000 with respect to the related person's guarantee of PS Liability 2).

# Example 2

Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that, instead of loaning $200 to the partnership, the partner has a $100 DRO and a $20 negative tax capital account and the partnership enters $1,520 as the ending balance of the partner's share of recourse liabilities in item K1 of the Schedule K-1 for tax Year 1. For tax Year 1, the partnership would enter $1,520 in box 20 under code X as the aggregate ending balance of the partner's or related person's payment obligations. On the attached statement, the partnership would separately identify each of the partner's or related person's payment obligations (for example, $500 with respect to the partner's guarantee of PS Liability 1, $1,000 with respect to the related person's guarantee of PS Liability 2, and $20 with respect to the partner's DRO).

# Net investment income (code Y)

Use code Y to report any information that may be relevant for partners to figure their NIIT when the information isn't otherwise identifiable elsewhere on Schedule K-1. Attach a statement that shows a description and dollar amount of each relevant item.

Examples of items reported using code Y may include the following.

- Net rental real estate income reported on Form 1065, Schedule K, line 2, and other net rental income reported on Form 1065, Schedule K, line 3c, derived from a section 212 for-profit activity (and not from a section 162 trade or business).
- Gains and losses from dispositions of assets attributable to a section 212 for-profit activity (and not from a section 162 trade or business).
- Gain reported on the installment sale basis (or attributable to a private annuity) that is attributable to the disposition of property held in a trade or business.
- Gain or loss from the disposition of a partnership interest, but only if such partnership was engaged, directly or indirectly, in one or more trades or businesses, and at least one of those trades or businesses wasn't trading in financial instruments or commodities.
- The partner’s distributive share of interest income, or interest expense, which is attributable to a loan between the partnership and the partner (self-charged interest).
- If the partnership received a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), the detail and amounts reported to the partnership in box 20 using code Y.
- If the partnership received a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), the amount of the adjustment reported.
- Guaranteed payments (reported on Form 1065, Schedule K, line 4b) unrelated to services, such as for the use of capital or attributable to section 736(a)(2) payments for unrealized receivables or goodwill.
- In the case of a common trust fund, any items of income or loss that may be taken into account in figuring the participant’s net investment income (other than qualified dividends, and short-term and long-term capital gains).
- Gain from a trade or business of trading in securities or commodities for which the partnership has elected under section 475(f) to mark to market the securities, the commodities, or both.

In addition, Regulations section 1.1411-10 provides special rules for stock of CFCs and PFICs owned by the partnership.

# Section 199A information (code Z)

The qualified business income (QBI) deduction may be taken by eligible taxpayers, including individuals and some trusts and estates. The deduction is determined at the partner level. Partnerships are required to report information necessary for their partners to figure the deduction. Use code Z with an asterisk (Z*) on each partner’s Schedule K-1 and enter “STMT” in the entry space to indicate that the information is provided on an attached statement that separately identifies the partner’s distributive share of:

- Qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss;
- W-2 wages;
- Unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of qualified property;
- Qualified PTP items; and
- Qualified REIT dividends.

The partnership must make an initial determination of which items are qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss at its level and report to each partner its distributive share of all items that may be qualified items at the partner level. These items must be separately stated where necessary for the partner to figure the deduction. See Determining the partnership’s QBI or qualified PTP items, later. The partner must then determine whether each item is includible in QBI.

In addition, the partnership must also report whether any of its trades or businesses are specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs) and identify on the statement any trades or businesses that are aggregated. The partnership must also report all QBI information reported to it by any entity in which the partnership has an ownership interest.

Note. The partnership must report each partner’s share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a PTP so that partners can determine their qualified PTP income. However, the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property from the PTP shouldn't be reported because partners can't use that information in figuring their QBI deduction.

Partnerships should use Statement A—QBI Pass-Through Entity Reporting, later, or a substantially similar statement, to report information for each partner’s distributive share from each trade or business, including QBI items, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified PTP items, and qualified REIT dividends by attaching the completed statement(s) to each partner’s Schedule K-1. The partnership should also use Statement A to report each partner’s distributive share of QBI items, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, qualified PTP items, and qualified REIT dividends reported to the partnership by another entity.

Partnerships should use Statement B—QBI Pass-Through Entity Aggregation Election(s), later, or a substantially similar statement, to report aggregated trades or businesses and provide supporting information to partners on each Schedule K-1.

Partnerships should use Statement C—QBI Pass-Through Entity Reporting—Patrons of Specified Agricultural and Horticultural Cooperatives, later, or a substantially similar statement, to report the distributive share of QBI and W-2 wages allocable to qualified payments from a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative for each trade or business. This statement should also be used to report each partner’s share of section 199A(g) deduction reported to the partnership by the specified cooperative.

# Determining the partnership’s qualified trades or businesses

The partnership’s qualified trades or businesses
---
# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

include its section 162 trades or businesses, except for SSTBs, or the trade or business of providing services as an employee. A section 162 trade or business generally includes any activity if the partnership’s primary purpose for engaging in the activity is for income or profit and the partnership is involved in the activity with continuity and regularity. For more information on what qualifies as a trade or business for purposes of section 199A, see the Instructions for Form 8995, Qualified Business Income Deduction Simplified Computation; or the Instructions for Form 8995-A, Qualified Business Income Deduction.

# Rental real estate

Rental real estate may constitute a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction if the rental real estate:

- Rises to the level of a trade or business under section 162,
- Satisfies the requirements for the rental real estate safe harbor in Rev. Proc. 2019-38, or
- Meets the self-rental exception (that is, the rental or licensing of property to a commonly controlled trade or business conducted by an individual or relevant pass-through entity) described in Regulations section 1.199A-1(b)(14).

The determination of whether rental real estate constitutes a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction is made by the partnership. The partnership must first make this determination and then only include the distributive share of rental real estate items of income, gain, loss, and deduction from a trade or business on the statement provided to partners. Rental real estate that doesn't meet any of the three conditions noted above doesn't constitute a trade or business for purposes of the QBI deduction and must not be included in the QBI information provided to partners.

# SSTBs excluded from qualified trades or businesses

SSTBs are generally excluded from the definition of a qualified trade or business. An SSTB is any trade or business providing services in the field of health, law, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, investing and investment management, trading or dealing in securities, partnership interests, or commodities, or any other trade or business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners. The term “any trade or business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners” means any trade or business that consists of (a) a trade or business in which a person receives fees, compensation, or other income from endorsing products or services; (b) a trade or business in which a person licenses or receives fees, compensation, or other income for the use of an individual’s image, likeness, name, signature, voice, or trademark, or any other symbols associated with the individual’s identity; or (c) receiving fees, compensation, or other income for appearing at an event or on radio, television, or another media format.

Partnerships must separately report QBI information for all trades or businesses engaged in by the partnership, including SSTBs, but must identify which trades or businesses are SSTBs.

# Aggregation of trades or businesses

A partnership engaged in more than one trade or business may choose to aggregate multiple trades or businesses into a single trade or business for purposes of section 199A if it meets the following requirements.

1. The same person, or group of persons, either directly or through attribution, owns 50% or more of each trade or business for a majority of the tax year, including the last day of the tax year, and all trades or businesses use the same tax year-end.
2. None of the trades or businesses are SSTBs.
3. The trades or businesses to be aggregated meet at least two of the following three factors.
1. They provide products, property, or services that are the same or that are customarily offered together.
2. They share facilities or share significant centralized business elements, such as personnel, accounting, legal, manufacturing, purchasing, human resources, or information technology resources.
3. They’re operated in coordination with, or reliance on, one or more of the businesses in the aggregated group.

If the partnership chooses to aggregate multiple trades or businesses, it must report the aggregation on Statement B, or a substantially similar statement, and attach it to each Schedule K-1. The statement must provide the information necessary to identify each separate trade or business included in each aggregation, a description of the aggregated trades or businesses, and an explanation of the factors met that allow the aggregation in accordance with Regulations section 1.199A-4. The aggregation statement must be completed each year to show the partnership's trade or business aggregations. Failure to disclose the aggregations may cause them to be disaggregated.

The partnership's aggregations must be reported consistently for all subsequent years, unless there's a change in facts and circumstances that changes or disqualifies the aggregation. The partnership must provide a written explanation for any changes to prior year aggregations that describes the change in facts and circumstances.

If the partnership directly or indirectly owns an interest in another relevant pass-through entity (RPE) that aggregates multiple trades or businesses, it must attach a copy of the RPE’s aggregation to each Schedule K-1. The partnership can't break apart the aggregation of another RPE, but it may add trades or businesses to the aggregation, assuming the requirements above are satisfied.

# Determining the partnership’s QBI or qualified PTP items

The partnership’s items of QBI include qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from the partnership’s trades or businesses that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. This may include, but isn't limited to, items such as ordinary business income or losses, section 1231 gains or (losses), section 179 deductions, and interest from debt-financed distributions.

QBI may also include rental income/losses or royalty income, if the activity rises to the level of a trade or business; and gambling gains or losses, but only if the partnership is engaged in the trade or business of gambling. Whether an activity rises to the level of a trade or business must be determined at the entity level and, once made, is binding on partners.

Qualified PTP items include the partnership’s share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from an interest in a PTP and may also include gain or loss recognized on the disposition of the partner’s partnership interest that isn't treated as a capital gain or loss. If the reporting partnership is itself a PTP, the PTP should report all qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss separately for each trade or business engaged in by the PTP.

QBI and qualified PTP items don’t include the following.

- Items that aren’t properly includible in income.
- Items that are treated as capital gain or loss under any provision of the Code.
- Dividends or dividend equivalents, including qualified REIT dividends.
- Interest income (unless received in connection with the trade or business).
- Wage income.
- Income that isn't effectively connected with the conduct of business within the United States (go to IRS.gov/ECI for more information).
- Commodities transactions, or foreign currency gains or losses described in section 954(c)(1)(C) or (D).
---
- Income, loss, or deductions from notional principal contracts under section 954(c)(1)(F).
- Annuities (unless received in connection with the trade or business).
- Guaranteed payments described in section 707(c) received by the entity for services rendered to a partnership.
- Payments described in section 707(a) received by the entity for services rendered to a partnership.

# QBI flowchart

Partnerships may use this flowchart to determine if an item of income, gain, deduction, or loss is includible in QBI reportable to partners.

# Flowchart To Help Determine if Items Are Qualified Business Income

# Questions

1. Is the item effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States?
2. Is the item attributable to a trade or business (this may include section 1231 gain/(loss), section 179 deductions, interest from debt-financed distributions, etc.)? Examples of an item not considered attributable to the trade or business at the entity level include gambling income/(loss) where the entity isn't engaged in the trade or business of gambling, income/(loss) from vacation properties when the entity isn't in that trade or business, activities not engaged in for profit, etc.
3. Is the item treated as a capital gain or loss under any provision of the Code or is it a dividend or dividend equivalent?
4. Is the item interest income other than interest income properly allocable to a trade or business? (Note that interest income attributable to an investment of working capital, reserves, or similar accounts isn't properly allocable to a trade or business.)
5. Is the item an annuity, other than an annuity received in connection with the trade or business?
6. Is the item gain or loss from a commodities transaction or foreign currency gain or loss described in section 954(c)(1)(C) or (D)?
7. Is the item gain or loss from a notional principal contract under section 954(c)(1)(F)?
8. Is the item of income or loss from a qualified PTP?

# Specific instructions for Statement A—QBI Pass-Through Entity Reporting

QBI or qualified PTP items. The partnership (including PTPs) must first determine if it's engaged in one or more trades or businesses. It must then determine if any of its trades or businesses are SSTBs. It must also determine whether it has qualified PTP items from an interest in a PTP. It must indicate the status in the appropriate checkboxes for each trade or business (or aggregated trade or business) reported.

Note. SSTBs and PTPs can't be aggregated with any other trade or business. So, if the Aggregation box is checked, the SSTB and PTP boxes for that specific aggregated trade or business shouldn't be checked.

Next, the partnership must report to each partner their distributive share of all items that are QBI or qualified PTP items for each trade or business the partnership owns directly or indirectly. Use the QBI flowchart above to determine if an item is reportable as a QBI item or qualified PTP item subject to partner-specific determinations.

The descriptions on the statement generally match the descriptions reported on Schedule K-1. So, the amounts should reflect each trade’s or business’s portion of the qualified items of income, gain, deduction, or loss reported in the applicable box of the partner’s Schedule K-1. For example, the amount reported on the “Ordinary business income (loss)” line of this statement should reflect the attributable portion of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss for each trade or business included in the “Ordinary business income (loss)” reported in box 1 of the partner’s Schedule K-1. Each item included under “Other income (loss)” and “Other deductions” must be stated separately, identifying the nature and amount of each item.

W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property. The partnership must determine the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property properly allocable to QBI for each qualified trade or business and report the distributive share to each partner on Statement A, or a substantially similar statement, attached to Schedule K-1. This includes the pro rata share of W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property reported to the partnership from any qualified trades or businesses of an RPE the partnership owns directly or indirectly. However, partnerships that own a direct or indirect interest in a PTP may not include any amounts for W-2 wages or UBIA of qualified property from the PTP, as the W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property from a PTP aren't allowed in figuring the W-2 wage and UBIA limitations.

The W-2 wages are amounts paid to employees described in sections 6051(a)(3) and (8). If the partnership conducts more than one trade or business, it must allocate the W-2 wages among its trades or businesses. See Rev. Proc. 2019-11, 2019-09 I.R.B. 742, for more information.

The unadjusted basis of qualified property is figured by adding the unadjusted basis of all qualified assets immediately after acquisition. Qualified property includes all tangible property subject to depreciation under section 167, for which the depreciable period hasn’t ended, that is held and used by the trade or business during the tax year and held on the last day of the tax year. The depreciable period ends on the later of 10 years after the property is placed in service or the last day of the full year for the applicable recovery period under section 168.

Qualified REIT dividends. The partnership must report the distributive share of any qualified REIT dividends to each partner on Statement A, or a substantially similar statement, attached to Schedule K-1. Qualified REIT dividends don’t have to be separately reported by trades or businesses and can be reported as a single amount to partners. Qualified REIT dividends include any dividend the partnership receives on REIT stock held for more than 45 days (taking into account the
---
principles of sections 246(c)(3) and (4)) during the 91-day period beginning on the date that is 45 days before the date on which such stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend, for which the payment isn't obligated to someone else, isn't a capital gain dividend under section 857(b)(3), and isn't a qualified dividend under section 1(h)(11), plus any section 199A dividends received from a RIC that are permitted to be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Regulations section 1.199A-3(d).

Fiscal year partnerships. For purposes of determining the QBI or qualified PTP items, UBIA of qualified property, and the aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends, fiscal year-end partnerships include all items from the tax (fiscal) year.

For purposes of determining W-2 wages, fiscal year-end partnerships include amounts paid to employees under sections 6051(a)(3) and (8) for the calendar year ended with or within the partnership’s tax year. If the partnership conducts more than one trade or business, it must allocate W-2 wages among its trades or businesses. See Rev. Proc. 2019-11 for more information.

# Specific instructions for Statement B—QBI Pass-Through Entity Aggregation Election(s)

If the partnership elects to aggregate more than one trade or business that meets all the requirements to aggregate, the partnership must report the aggregation to partners on Statement B, or a substantially similar statement, and attach it to each Schedule K-1. The partnership must indicate trades or businesses that were aggregated by checking the appropriate box on Statement A for each aggregated trade or business. The partnership must also provide a description of the aggregated trade or business and an explanation of the factors met that allow the aggregation.

The aggregation statement must be completed each year to show the partnership’s trade or business aggregations. Failure to disclose the aggregations may cause them to be disaggregated.

Section 704(c) information (code AA). For partnerships other than PTPs, if a partner’s taxable income or loss on any line item on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) includes an allocation of any income or deduction item determined by applying section 704(c), include the sum of such income and deduction items here.

Example 1—single section 704(c) allocation. Partnership P has two partners, A and B. A and B share all items of income, loss, and deduction equally, except for items required to be allocated under section 704(c). A contributes property X with an FMV of $100 and a tax basis of $60. X is depreciable over 10 years. B contributes $100. The traditional method is used to
---
Allocate section 704(c) items pertaining to X. In the first year, the partnership has $10 of section 704(b) book depreciation, which is allocated equally to A and B for book purposes ($5 each). However, P only has $6 of tax depreciation. The partnership has no other income or deductions during the tax year. Under the traditional method, P allocates $1 to A and $5 to B for tax purposes. Assuming this is the only item where taxable income is affected by section 704(c) allocations during the current year, the partnership would report deductions of $1 for A and $5 for B in box 20, code AA, of Schedule K-1.

# Example 2—multiple section 704(c) allocations

The facts are the same as in Example 1, except in addition to the facts in that example, A also contributes property Y with an FMV of $100 and a remaining tax basis of $0. If Y were newly placed in service, its depreciable life would be 10 years straight line. The partnership adopts the remedial method with respect to property Y. In the first year, P has $10 of section 704(b) book depreciation, which is allocated equally to A and B for book purposes ($5 each). However, P has $0 of tax depreciation with respect to property Y. Under the remedial method, for tax purposes, P allocates $5 of remedial income to A and $5 of a remedial depreciation deduction to B with respect to property Y. In this case, the partnership would report in box 20, code AA, of Schedule K-1 that A has $4 of taxable income, determined by applying section 704(c) ($1 of depreciation deductions from property X and $5 of remedial income from property Y) and that B has $10 of deductions for tax purposes, determined by applying section 704(c) (consisting of $5 depreciation from property X and $5 remedial depreciation from property Y).

# Required reporting for the sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership (codes AB, AC, and AD)

When a sale or exchange of a partnership interest occurs and the partnership holds section 751 property such as unrealized receivables defined in section 751(c), property subject to unrecaptured section 1250 gain, inventory items defined in section 751(d), or collectibles, the partnership must report to the transferor partner their share of the gain or loss figured for the following categories of assets. If there was an exchange described in section 751(a), this information must also be reported on Form 8308.

# Section 751 gain (loss) (code AB)

Section 751 “hot assets” (unrealized receivables and inventory items).

In addition to the information reported in box 20c for codes AC and AD, you may separately need to report in boxes 9b and 9c the amount of collectibles (28%) gain (loss) and unrecaptured section 1250 gain flowing through the partnership.

# Section 1(h)(5) collectibles gain (code AC)

Section 1(h)(5) collectible assets.

# Section 1(h)(6) unrecaptured section 1250 gain (code AD)

Section 1(h)(6) unrecaptured section 1250 gain assets (depreciable real property) are section 751 property per Regulations section 1.751-1(c)(4)(v).

# Excess taxable income (code AE)

If the partnership is required to file Form 8990, it may determine it has excess taxable income. If so, enter the amount from Form 8990, Part II, line 36, for excess taxable income.

# Schedule K-1

Enter the partner’s amount of excess taxable income. The partner will enter the amount in Form 8990, Schedule A, line 43, column (f), if the partner is required to file Form 8990.

# Excess business interest income (code AF)

If the partnership is required to file Form 8990, it may determine it has excess business interest income. If so, enter the amount from Form 8990, Part II, line 37, for excess business interest income.

# Schedule K-1

Enter the partner’s amount of excess business interest income. The partner will enter the amount in Form 8990, Schedule A, line 43, column (g), if the partner is required to file Form 8990.

# Gross receipts for section 448(c) (code AG)

Regulations section 1.163(j)-2(d)(2)(iii) requires that partners in a partnership include a share of partnership gross receipts in proportion to their share of gross income under section 703 (unless the partnership is treated as one person under the aggregation rules of section 448(c)). Partnerships with current year gross receipts (defined in Temporary Regulations section 1.448-1T(f)(2)(iv)) greater than $5 million are required to report to partners their distributive shares of their current year gross receipts, as well as their distributive shares of gross receipts for the 3 immediately preceding tax years. If a partnership and a partner are treated as a single employer under the section 448(c) aggregation rules, and the partnership has current year gross receipts greater than $5 million, then the partnership should also report its current year total gross receipts, as well as its total gross receipts for the 3 immediately preceding tax years, to that partner. See IRS.gov/newsroom/faqs-regarding-the-aggregation-rules-under-section-448c2-that-apply-to-the-section-163j-small-business-exemption. Partnerships whose current year gross receipts are less than or equal to $5 million may also use this code to report gross receipts.

# Noncash charitable contributions (code AH)

If the partnership made a noncash charitable contribution, report the partner’s share of the partnership’s adjusted basis of the property for basis limitation purposes.

# Interest and tax on deferred compensation to partners (code AI)

Interest and additional tax on deferred compensation under a section 409A nonqualified deferred compensation plan that doesn't meet the requirements of section 409A. Include in this amount any earnings on these deferrals. This amount must also be included on Schedule K, line 4. For details, see the regulations under section 409A. These regulations don't provide guidance on the application of section 409A to arrangements between partnerships and partners. For interim guidance on such arrangements, see Q&A-7 in Notice 2005-1, 2005-2 I.R.B. 274, and the information provided in T.D. 9321. Also see Notice 2006-79, 2006-43 I.R.B. 763; Notice 2007-86, 2007-46 I.R.B. 990; and Notice 2008-113, 2008-51 I.R.B. 1305, for additional information on transitional and relief rules.

# Excess business loss limitation (code AJ)

# Foreign partners, Form 8990, Schedule A (code AY)

Form 8990, Schedule A, requires certain foreign partners to report their allocable share of EBIE, excess taxable income, and excess business interest income, if any, that is attributable to income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Provide on Schedule K-1 the information needed to complete Form 8990, Schedule A, for a partner that is a foreign corporation or nonresident alien or is a partnership (domestic or foreign) in which you know, or have reason to know, that one or more of the partners is a foreign corporation or nonresident alien.

# Inversion gain (code AP)

# IRA disclosure (code AR)

For IRA partners with an amount reported in box 20, code V, include code AR with the IRA partner's unique EIN (not the custodian's EIN). The information on line 21 is solely for purposes of computing basis. A partnership must complete Schedules K-2 and K-3 to provide the information necessary for the partner to claim a foreign tax credit.

# Line 21. Total Foreign Taxes Paid or Accrued

Enter in U.S. dollars the total creditable foreign taxes (described in section 901 or 903) that were paid or accrued by the partnership (according to its method of accounting for such taxes). Enter the amount paid or accrued on line 21. Translate these amounts into U.S. dollars by using the applicable exchange rate (see Pub. 514, Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals).

# Line 22. More Than One At-Risk Activity

If the partnership conducted more than one at-risk activity, the partnership is required to provide certain information separately for each at-risk activity to its partners. This information is reported on an attached statement to Schedule K-1. Check the box to indicate there's more than one at-risk activity for which a statement is attached. See At-risk activity reporting requirements, earlier, for details.

# Qualifying advanced energy project property (code AT)

---
# Partnerships Required To File Schedule M-3

For partnerships required to file Schedule M-3, the amounts reported on Schedule L must be amounts from financial statements used to complete Schedule M-3. If the partnership prepares non-tax-basis financial statements, Schedule M-3 and Schedule L must report non-tax-basis financial statement amounts. If the partnership doesn't prepare non-tax-basis financial statements, Schedule L must be based on the partnership's books and records and may show tax-basis balance sheet amounts if the partnership's books and records reflect only tax-basis amounts.

# Line 5. Tax-Exempt Securities

Include on this line:

- State and local government obligations, the interest on which is excludable from gross income under section 103(a); and
- Stock in a mutual fund or other RIC that distributed exempt-interest dividends during the tax year of the partnership.

# Line 7a. Loans to Partners (or Persons Related to Partners)

Include on this line loans to partners or persons related to partners. Persons are related if they have a relationship specified in section 267(b) or 707(b). Amounts included here shouldn't be included elsewhere on lines 1 through 13.

# Line 14. Total Assets

Generally, total assets at the beginning of the year (Schedule L, line 14, column (b)) must equal total assets at the close of the prior tax year (Schedule L, line 14, column (d)). If total assets at the beginning of the year don't equal total assets at the close of the prior year, attach a statement explaining the difference.

For purposes of measuring total assets at the end of the year, the partnership's assets may not be netted against or reduced by partnership liabilities. In addition, asset amounts may not be reported as a negative number. If the partnership has an interest in another partnership and uses a tax-basis method for Schedule L, it must show as an asset the adjusted basis of its interest in the other partnership and separately show as a liability its share of the other partnership's liabilities (which are included in the computation of its adjusted basis). See the Partner's Instructions for Schedule K-1 for details on how to figure the adjusted basis of a partnership interest. If Schedule L is non-tax-basis, investment in a partnership may be shown as appropriate under the non-tax-basis accounting method of the partnership including, if required by the non-tax-basis accounting method of the partnership, the equity method of accounting for investments, but must be shown as a non-negative amount.

# Example

Partnership A prepares a tax-basis Schedule L and is a general partner in Partnership B, a general partnership. Partnership A's adjusted basis in Partnership B at the end of the year is $16 million. Partnership A's share of Partnership B's liabilities is $20 million, which is included in the $16 million adjusted basis amount. On its Schedule L, Partnership A must report $16 million on line 8 as the amount of its investment asset in Partnership B and report on line 20 its $20 million share of Partnership B's liabilities. These amounts can't be netted on Schedule L.

# Line 18. All Nonrecourse Loans

Nonrecourse loans are those liabilities of the partnership for which no partner bears the economic risk of loss. If the partnership's nonrecourse liabilities include its share of the liabilities of another partnership, the partnership's share of those liabilities must be reflected on line 18.

# Instructions for Form 1065 (2024)

Line 19a. Loans From Partners (or Persons Related to Partners)

Include on this line loans from partners or persons related to partners. Persons are related if they have a relationship specified in section 267(b) or 707(b). Amounts included here shouldn't be included elsewhere on lines 15 through 21.

Line 20. Other Liabilities

A partnership that is a partner in a tiered partnership must include as a liability on line 20 the partner's share of the tiered partnership's liabilities to the extent they are recourse liabilities to the partner.

# Schedule M-2. Analysis of Partners' Capital Accounts

Show what caused changes during the tax year in the partners' tax-basis capital accounts.

Line 1. Balance at Beginning of Year

The balance at the beginning of the year should equal the total of the amounts reported as the partners’ beginning tax-basis capital accounts in item L of all the partners’ Schedules K-1. If not, the partnership should attach an explanation of the difference. Generally, the balance at the beginning of the year should equal the adjusted tax basis of the partnership’s assets at the beginning of the year reduced by the partnership’s liabilities at the beginning of the year. If the partnership’s balance sheet (Schedule L) is reported on the tax basis and if the aggregate of the partners’ beginning and ending capital accounts differs from the amounts reported on Schedule L, attach a statement reconciling any differences. No such reconciliation is required if Schedule L isn't reported on the tax basis.

Line 2. Capital Contributed During Year

Include on line 2a the amount of money contributed by each partner to the partnership, as reflected on the partnership's books and records. Include on line 2b the adjusted tax basis of property net of liabilities contributed by each partner to the partnership, as reflected on the partnership’s books and records.

Line 3. Net Income (Loss)

Enter on Schedule M-2, line 3, the amount from the Analysis of Net Income (Loss) per Return, line 1. Generally, this is the same as the amount entered on Schedule M-1, line 9 (if the partnership is required to complete Schedule M-1), or, if the partnership files Schedule M-3, the amount in column (d) of Schedule M-3, Part II, line 26. Because section 743(b) basis adjustments and income from guaranteed payments aren't included in the partners' tax-basis capital accounts, certain adjustments may be necessary. If adjustments to income under section 743(b) are taken into account in calculating net income (loss), remove the effects of those adjustments (for example, by adding or subtracting the income, gain, loss, or deduction resulting from those adjustments on line 4 or line 7 in accordance with the instructions for those lines). If net income includes income from guaranteed payments made to partners, remove such income on line 7.

Line 4. Other Increases (Itemize)

Enter on line 4 the sum of all other increases to the partners' tax-basis capital accounts during the year not reflected on lines 2 and 3. Also, if the aggregate net negative income from all section 743(b) adjustments reported on Schedule K, line 13e, was included as a decrease to income in arriving at net income (loss) on line 3, report those amounts as an increase on line 4. For these purposes, “net negative income from all section 743(b) adjustments” means the excess of all section 743(b) adjustments to income allocated to the partner that decrease partner taxable income over all section 743(b) adjustments to income that increase partner taxable income.
---
# Line 6. Distributions

# Line 6a. Cash.

Enter the amount of money distributed to each partner by the partnership. For purposes of line 6a, money includes marketable securities, as described in section 731(c).

# Line 6b. Property.

Enter the sum of the adjusted tax bases of property net of liabilities distributed to each partner by the partnership as reflected on the partnership's books and records. Include withdrawals from inventory for the personal use of a partner.

# Line 7. Other Decreases (Itemize)

Adjustments reported on Schedule K, line 11, was included as an increase to income in arriving at net income (loss) on line 3, report that amount as a decrease on line 7. For these purposes, “net positive income from all section 743(b) adjustments” means the excess of all section 743(b) adjustments to income allocated to the partner that increase the partner's taxable income over all section 743(b) adjustments to income that decrease the partner's taxable income. Likewise, if line 3 includes income from guaranteed payments reported on Schedule K, line 4c, include that amount as a decrease on line 7.

# Line 9. Balance at End of Year

The balance at the end of the year should equal the total of the amounts reported as the partners’ ending capital accounts in item L of all the partners’ Schedules K-1. Enter on line 7 the sum of all other decreases to the partners' tax-basis capital accounts during the year not reflected on line 6. Also, if the aggregate net positive income from all section 743(b).

# Paperwork Reduction Act Notice

We ask for the information on these forms to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States. You're required to give us the information. We need it to ensure that you're complying with these laws and to allow us to figure and collect the right amount of tax.

You aren’t required to provide the information requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB control number. Books or records relating to a form or its instructions must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any Internal Revenue law. Generally, tax returns and return information are confidential, as required by section 6103.

# Estimates of taxpayer burden

The following tables show burden estimates based on current statutory requirements as of December 2024, for taxpayers filing 2024 Forms 1065, 1120, 1120-C, 1120-F, 1120-H, 1120-ND, 1120-S, 1120-SF, 1120-FSC, 1120-L, 1120-PC, 1066, 1120-REIT, 1120-RIC, 1120-POL, and related attachments. Time spent and out-of-pocket costs are presented separately. Time burden is broken out by taxpayer activity, with reporting representing the largest component. Out-of-pocket costs include any expenses incurred by taxpayers to prepare and submit their tax returns. Examples include tax return preparation and submission fees, postage and photocopying costs, and tax preparation software costs. While these estimates don't include burden associated with post-filing activities, IRS operational data indicate that electronically prepared and filed returns have fewer arithmetic errors, implying lower post-filing burden.

Reported time and cost burdens are national averages and don't necessarily reflect a “typical” case. Most taxpayers experience lower-than-average burden, with taxpayer burden varying considerably by taxpayer type.

The average burden for partnerships filing Forms 1065 and related attachments is about 60 hours and $5,000; the average burden for corporations filing Forms 1120 and associated forms is about 100 hours and $7,400; and the average burden for Forms 1120-REIT, 1120-RIC, and 1120-S, and all related attachments is 60 hours and $4,500. Within each of these estimates, there's significant variation in taxpayer activity. Tax preparation fees and other out-of-pocket costs vary extensively depending on the tax situation of the taxpayer, the type of software or professional preparer used, and the geographic location. Third-party burden hours aren't included in these estimates.

# Codes for Principal Business Activity and Principal Product or Service

Using the list of activities and codes below, determine from which activity the business derives the largest percentage of its “total receipts.” Total receipts is defined as the sum of gross receipts or sales (page 1, line 1a); all other income (page 1, lines 4 through 7); income reported on Schedule K, lines 3a, 5, 6a, and 7; income or net gain reported on Schedule K, lines 8, 9a, 10, and 11; and income or net gain reported on Form 8825, lines 2, 19, and 20a. If the business purchases raw materials and supplies them to a subcontractor to produce the finished product, but retains title to the product, the business is considered a manufacturer and must use one of the manufacturing codes (311110–339900).

Once the Principal Business Activity is determined, enter the six-digit code from the list below on page 1, item C. Also enter the business activity in item A and a brief description of the principal product or service of the business in item B.
