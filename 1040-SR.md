# Helpful Hints

For 2024, you will use Form 1040 or, if you were born before January 2, 1960, you have the option to use Form 1040-SR.

You may only need to file Form 1040 or 1040-SR and none of the numbered schedules, Schedules 1 through 3. However, if your return is more complicated (for example, you claim certain deductions or credits or owe additional taxes), you will need to complete one or more of the numbered schedules. Below is

# The Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Here To Help You

# What is the Taxpayer Advocate Service?

The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is an independent organization within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that helps taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights. TAS strives to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and understand your rights under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

# What can TAS do for you?

TAS can help you if your tax problem is causing a financial difficulty, you've tried and been unable to resolve your issue with the IRS, or you believe an IRS system, process, or procedure just isn't working as it should. And the service is free. If you qualify for TAS assistance, you will be assigned to one advocate who will work with you throughout the process and will do everything possible to resolve your issue. TAS can help you if:

- Your problem is causing a financial difficulty for you, your family, or your business.
- You face (or your business is facing) an immediate threat of adverse action.
- You’ve tried to contact the IRS but no one has responded, or the IRS hasn’t responded by the date promised.

# How can you reach TAS?

TAS has offices in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To find your advocate’s number:

- Go to TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/contact-us;
- Download Publication 1546, Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Your Voice at the IRS. If you do not have Internet access, you can call the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676) and ask for a copy of Publication 1546;
- Check your local directory; or
- Call TAS toll free at 877-777-4778.

# How can you learn about your taxpayer rights?

The Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes 10 basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. The TAS website TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov can help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are your rights. Know them. Use them.

# How else does TAS help taxpayers?

TAS works to resolve large-scale problems that affect many taxpayers. If you know of one of these broad issues, please report it to TAS at IRS.gov/SAMS. Be sure not to include any personal taxpayer information.

# Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers

Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS). LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with the IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition, LITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak English as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see the LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/LITCMap or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List. This publication is available online at IRS.gov/Forms-Pubs or by calling the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676).

# Suggestions for Improving the IRS

# Taxpayer Advocacy Panel

Taxpayers have an opportunity to provide direct feedback to the IRS through the Taxpayer Advocacy Panel (TAP). The TAP is a Federal Advisory Committee comprised of an independent panel of citizen volunteers who listen to taxpayers, identify taxpayers' systemic issues, and make suggestions for improving IRS customer service.

# Affordable Care Act — What You Need To Know

# Requirement To Reconcile Advance Payments of the Premium Tax Credit

The premium tax credit helps pay premiums for health insurance purchased from the Health Insurance Marketplace (the Marketplace). Eligible individuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance company.

If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the premium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach Form 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year.

1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace.
2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments.
3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. (Don’t include Form 1095-A.)

# Health Coverage Reporting

If you or someone in your family was an employee in 2024, the employer may be required to send you Form 1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if so, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2025. This information may be relevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2024 through the Marketplace and wish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don’t need to wait to receive this form to file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don’t wish to claim the premium tax credit for 2024, you don’t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C. For more information on who is eligible for the premium tax credit, see the Instructions for Form 8962.

Reminder: Health care coverage. If you need health care coverage, go to www.HealthCare.gov to learn about health insurance options for you and your family, how to buy health insurance, and how you might qualify to get financial assistance to buy health insurance.

# Choosing to treat a nonresident alien or dual-status alien spouse as U.S. resident

If you and your spouse choose to treat a nonresident alien or dual-status alien spouse as a U.S. resident for 2024, or if a prior year's choice to treat a nonresident alien spouse as a U.S. resident remains in effect for 2024, check the box in the Filing Status section and enter the name of the nonresident alien or dual-status alien spouse in the entry space. See Nonresident aliens and dual-status aliens, later.

# Updated reporting requirements for Form 1099-K

For 2024, payment card companies, payment apps, and online marketplaces will be required to send you a Form 1099-K when the amount of your business transactions during the year is more than $5,000. In calendar year 2025, the threshold will lower to more than $2,500 and for 2026 and later years, the threshold will be more than $600.

# Changes to reporting amounts from Form 1099-K

Beginning in 2024, if you received a Form(s) 1099-K that shows payments that were included in error or for personal items sold at a loss, you will now enter these amounts in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. See Form(s) 1099-K, in the Schedule 1 instructions.

# Digital assets received as ordinary income

If you received digital assets as ordinary income, and that income is not reported elsewhere on your return, you will enter those amounts on Schedule 1, line 8v. See the instructions for Schedule 1, line 8v.

# Exception to the 10% additional tax for early distributions

Beginning in 2024, the exception to the 10% additional tax for early distributions includes distributions from a retirement plan to pay for certain emergency personal expenses and to victims of domestic violence. See Form 5329, Pub. 575, and Pub. 590-B.

# Purchase of savings bonds discontinued

The program allowing for your refund to be deposited into your Treasury-Direct® account to buy savings bonds, as well as the ability to buy paper bonds with your refund, has been discontinued. Form 8888 is now only used to split your direct deposit refund between two or more accounts or to split your refund between a direct deposit and a paper check. Go to TreasuryDirect.gov/Research-Center/FAQ-IRS-Tax-Feature.

# U.S. tax allocable to the U.S. Virgin Islands now reported on Schedule 3

If you use Form 8689 to figure your amount of U.S. tax allocable to the U.S. Virgin Islands, you will now report this amount on Schedule 3, line 13z. See the instructions for Schedule 3, line 13z.

# Reporting a transfer of a credit for a new or previously owned clean vehicle credit to a dealer at the time of sale

If you purchased a new or used clean vehicle from a registered dealer and reduced the amount you paid at the time of sale by transferring the credit to the dealer, you must file a tax return and attach Form 8936 and Schedule A (Form 8936) to report the transfer of the credit and reconcile your eligibility on your return.

# Filing

These rules apply to all U.S. citizens, regardless of where they live, and resident aliens.

# Requirements

Have you tried IRS e-file? It's the fastest way to get your refund and it's free if you are eligible. Visit IRS.gov for details.

Do You Have To File?

Use Chart A, B, or C to see if you must file a return. U.S. citizens who lived in or had income from a U.S. territory should see Pub. 570. Residents of Puerto Rico can use Tax Topic 901 to see if they must file.

Even if you do not otherwise have to file a return, you should file one to get a refund of any federal income tax withheld. You should also file if you are eligible for any of the following credits:

- Earned income credit.
- Additional child tax credit.
- American opportunity credit.
- Premium tax credit.

See Pub. 501 for details. Also see Pub. 501 if you do not have to file but received a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement).

# Requirement to reconcile advance payments of the premium tax credit.

If you, your spouse with whom you are filing a joint return, or a dependent was enrolled in coverage through the Marketplace for 2024 and advance payments of the premium tax credit were made for this coverage, you must file a 2024 return and attach Form 8962. You (or whoever enrolled you) should have received Form 1095-A from the Marketplace with information about your coverage and any advance payments.

You must attach Form 8962 even if someone else enrolled you, your spouse, or your dependent. If you are a dependent who is claimed on someone else's 2024 return, you do not have to attach Form 8962.

# Exception for certain children under age 19 or full-time students.

If certain conditions apply, you can elect to include on your return the income of a child who was under age 19 at the end of 2024 or was a full-time student under age 24 at the end of 2024. To do so, use Form 8814. If you make this election, your child doesn't have to file a return.

# What if You Can't File on Time?

You can get an automatic 6-month extension if, no later than the date your return is due, you file Form 4868. If you want to apply for an extension electronically, see Form 4868 for details.

An automatic 6-month extension to file doesn't extend the time to pay your tax. If you don’t pay your tax by the original due date of your return, you will owe interest on the unpaid tax and may owe penalties. See Form 4868.

If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you may qualify for an automatic extension of time to file without filing Form 4868. You qualify if, on the due date of your return, you meet one of the following conditions:

- You live outside the United States and Puerto Rico and your main place of business or post of duty is outside the United States and Puerto Rico.
- You are in military or naval service on duty outside the United States and Puerto Rico.

This extension gives you an extra 2 months to file and pay the tax, but interest will be charged from the original due date of the return on any unpaid tax. You must include a statement showing that you meet the requirements. If you are still unable to file your return by the end of the 2-month period, you can get an additional 4 months if, no later than June 16, 2025, you file Form 4868.
---
4-month extension of time to file doesn't extend the time to pay your tax. See Form 4868.

# Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR

What form to file. Everyone can file Form 1040. Form 1040-SR is available to you if you were born before January 2, 1960.

CAUTION

Fiscal year filers. If you are a fiscal year filer using a tax year other than January 1 through December 31, 2024, enter the beginning and ending months of your fiscal year in the entry space provided at the top of page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

Write-in information. If you need to write a word, code, and/or dollar amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR to explain an item of income or deduction, but don't have enough space to enter the word, code, and/or dollar amount, you can put an asterisk next to the applicable line number and put a footnote at the bottom of page 2 of your tax return indicating the line number and the word, code, and/or dollar amount you need to enter.

Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code.

# Name and Address

Enter any other information on that line, but also complete the spaces below that line. Don’t abbreviate the country name. Print or type the information in the spaces provided. If you are married filing a separate return, enter your spouse's name in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes instead of below your name. If you are currently incarcerated, enter your inmate identifying number near your last name.

# TIP

If you filed a joint return for 2023 and you are filing a joint return for 2024 with the same spouse, be sure to enter your names and SSNs in the same order as on your 2023 return.

# Death of a Taxpayer

If a taxpayer died before filing a return for 2024, the taxpayer's spouse or personal representative may have to file and sign a return for that taxpayer. A personal representative can be an executor, administrator, or anyone who is in charge of the deceased taxpayer's property. If the deceased taxpayer didn't have to file a return but had tax withheld, a return must be filed to get a refund. The person who files the return must enter “Deceased,” the deceased taxpayer's name, and the date of death across the top of the return. If this information isn't provided, it may delay the processing of the return.

# Name Change

If you changed your name because of marriage, divorce, etc., be sure to report the change to the Social Security Administration (SSA) before filing your return. This prevents delays in processing your return and issuing refunds. It also safeguards your future social security benefits.

# Address Change

If you plan to move after filing your return, use Form 8822 to notify the IRS of your new address.

# P.O. Box

Enter your box number only if your post office doesn't deliver mail to your home.

# Foreign Address

If you have a foreign address, enter the city name on the appropriate line. Don’t enter any other information on that line.

All payers of income, including financial institutions, should be promptly notified of the taxpayer's death. This will ensure the proper reporting of income earned by the taxpayer's estate or heirs. A deceased taxpayer's social security number shouldn't be used for tax purposes.

ployment and you lose your employ- butions from individuals and groups and places candidates on an equal financial footing in the general election. The fund also helps pay for pediatric medical re- search. If you want $3 to go to this fund, check the box. If you are filing a joint return, your spouse can also have $3 go to the fund. If you check a box, your tax or refund won't change.

# IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) for Aliens

If you are a nonresident or resident alien and you don’t have and aren’t eligible to get an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN.

If you already have an ITIN, enter it wherever your SSN is requested on your tax return.

Some ITINs must be renewed. If you haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax return at least once for tax years 2021, 2022, or 2023, it has expired and must be renewed if you need to file a federal tax return. You don't need to renew your ITIN if you don't need to file a federal tax return. You can find more information at IRS.gov/ITIN.

An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't entitle you to social security benefits or change your employment or immigration status under U.S. law.

For more information on ITINs, including application, expiration, and renewal, see Form W-7 and its instructions.

If you receive an SSN after previously using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS office or write a letter to the IRS explaining that you now have an SSN and want all your tax records combined under your SSN. Details about what to include with the letter and where to mail it are at IRS.gov/ITIN.

# Filing Status

Check only the filing status that applies to you. The ones that will usually give you the lowest tax are listed last.

- Married filing separately.
- Single.
- Head of household.
- Married filing jointly.
- Qualifying surviving spouse.

For information about marital status, see Pub. 501.

More than one filing status can apply to you. You can choose the one for which you qualify that will give you the lowest tax.

# Single

You can check the “Single” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any of the following was true on December 31, 2024:

- You were never married.
- You were legally separated according to your state law under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance. But if, at the end of 2024, your divorce wasn't final (an interlocutory decree), you are considered married and can't check the box.
- You were widowed before January 1, 2024, and didn't remarry before the end of 2024. But if you have a child, you may be able to use the qualifying surviving spouse filing status.

# Married Filing Jointly

You can check the “Married filing jointly” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any of the following apply:

- You were married at the end of 2024, even if you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2024.
- Your spouse died in 2024 and you didn't remarry in 2024.

# Nonresident Alien Spouse

If your spouse is a nonresident alien, your spouse must have either an SSN or an ITIN if:

- You file a joint return, or
- Your spouse is filing a separate return.

# Presidential Election Campaign Fund

This fund helps pay for Presidential election campaigns. The fund reduces candidates' dependence on large contributions from individuals and groups.

Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov.
---
# Filing Status

You may be able to file as head of household if you had a child living with you and you lived apart from your spouse during the last 6 months of 2024. See Married persons who live apart, later.

# Head of Household

To make either choice for 2024, you and your spouse must file a joint return and attach a statement, signed by both spouses, to your return. To find out what information must be included in the statement, as well as more information on these choices, see Nonresident Spouse Treated as a Resident for nonresident aliens and Choosing Resident Alien Status for dual-status aliens in Pub. 519.

# Married Filing Separately

Check the “Married filing separately” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if you are married, at the end of 2024, and file a separate return. Enter your spouse’s name in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes. Be sure to enter your spouse’s SSN or ITIN in the space for spouse’s SSN on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If your spouse doesn’t have and isn’t required to have an SSN or ITIN, enter “NRA” in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes.

For electronic filing, enter the spouse's name or “NRA” if the spouse doesn’t have an SSN or ITIN in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes.

If you are married and file a separate return, you generally report only your own income, deductions, and credits. Generally, you are responsible only for the tax on your own income. Different rules apply to people in community property states; see Pub. 555.

However, you will usually pay more tax than if you use another filing status for which you qualify. Also, if you file a separate return, you can't take the student loan interest deduction or the education credits, and you will only be able to take the earned income credit and child and dependent care credit in very limited circumstances. You also can't take the standard deduction if your spouse itemizes deductions. For situations when you might want to file separately, see Joint and several tax liability, earlier.

# Qualifying Child

To find out if someone is your qualifying child, see Step 1 under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later.

# Dependent

To find out if someone is your dependent, see Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later.

The dependents you claim are those you list by name and SSN in the Dependents section on Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

# Exception to Time Lived with You

Temporary absences by you or the other person for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juvenile facility, count as time lived in the home. Also see Kidnapped child, later, under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, if applicable.

If the person for whom you kept up a home was born or died in 2024, you still may be able to file as head of household. If the person is your qualifying child, the child must have lived with you for more than half the part of the year the child was alive. If the person is anyone else, see Pub. 501. Similarly, if you adopted the person for whom you kept up a home in 2024, the person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by.

# 2. You have a child or stepchild (not

a foster child) whom you can claim as a dependent or could claim as a dependent except that, for 2024:

- a. The child had gross income of $5,050 or more,
- b. The child filed a joint return, or
- c. You could be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s return.

If the child isn’t claimed as your dependent, enter the child’s name in the entry space below the filing status checkboxes. If you don’t enter the name, it will take us longer to process your return.

3. This child lived in your home for all of 2024. If the child didn't live with you for the required time, see Exception to time lived with you, later.

Keeping up a home. To find out what is included in the cost of keeping up a home, see Pub. 501.

# Married persons who live apart.

Even if you weren’t divorced or legally separated at the end of 2024, you are considered unmarried if all of the following apply.

- You lived apart from your spouse for the last 6 months of 2024. Temporary absences for special circumstances, such as for business, medical care, school, or military service, count as time lived in the home.
- You file a separate return from your spouse.
- You paid over half the cost of keeping up your home for 2024.

Your home was the main home of your child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half of 2024 (if half or less, see Exception to time lived with you, earlier).

You can claim this child as your dependent or could claim the child except that the child's other parent can claim the child under the rule for Children of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later.

# Adopted child.

An adopted child is always treated as your own child. An adopted child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption.

# Dependent.

To find out if someone is your dependent, see Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, later.

The dependents you claim are those you list by name and SSN in the Dependents section on Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

# Exception to time lived with you.

Temporary absences by you or the child for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juvenile facility, count as time lived in the home. Also see Kidnapped child, later, under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, if applicable.

A child is considered to have lived with you for all of 2024 if the child was born or died in 2024 and your home was the child's home for the entire time the child was alive. Similarly, if you adopted the child in 2024, or the child was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption.

# Qualifying Surviving Spouse

You can check the “Qualifying surviving spouse” box in the Filing Status section on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR and use joint return tax rates for 2024 if all of the following apply.

- Your spouse died in 2022 or 2023 and you didn't remarry before the end of 2024.

# Digital Assets

Digital assets are any digital representations of value that are recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology. For example, digital assets include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.

If a particular asset has the characteristics of a digital asset, it will be treated as a digital asset for federal income tax purposes.

Check the “Yes” box next to the question on digital assets on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR if at any time during 2024, you (a) received (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services); or (b) sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of a digital asset (or any financial interest in any digital asset).

For example, check “Yes” if at any time during 2024 you:

- Received digital assets as payment for property or services provided;
- Received digital assets as a result of a reward or award;
- Received new digital assets as a result of mining, staking, and similar activities;
- Received digital assets as a result of a hard fork;
- Disposed of digital assets in exchange for property or services;
- Disposed of a digital asset in exchange or trade for another digital asset;
- Sold a digital asset; or
- Otherwise disposed of any other financial interest in a digital asset.

You have a financial interest in a digital asset if you are the owner of record of a digital asset, or have an ownership stake in an account that holds one or more digital assets, including the rights and obligations to acquire a financial interest, or you own a wallet that holds digital assets.

The following actions or transactions in 2024, alone, generally don’t require you to check “Yes”:

# How To Report Digital Asset Transactions

If, in 2024, you disposed of any digital asset, which you held as a capital asset, through a sale, trade, exchange, payment, or other transfer, check “Yes” and use Form 8949 to calculate your capital gain or loss and report that gain or loss on Schedule D (Form 1040).

If you received any digital asset as compensation for services or disposed of any digital asset that you held for sale to customers in a trade or business, you must report the income as you would report other income of the same type (for example, W-2 wages on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a, or inventory or services on Schedule C).

If you received ordinary income in connection with digital assets that isn't reported elsewhere on your return, see the instructions for Schedule 1, line 8v.

If you disposed of any digital asset by gift, you may be required to file Form 709. See Who Must File and Transfers Subject to the Gift Tax in the Instructions for Form 709 for more information.

# Standard Deduction

If you are filing Form 1040-SR, you can find a Standard Deduction Chart on the last page of that form. Don’t file the Standard Deduction Chart with your return.

# Single and Married Filing Jointly

Your spouse isn't considered age 65. Don’t check the box.

If you or your spouse (if you are married and filing a joint return) can be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s return, check the appropriate box in the Standard Deduction section.

Death of taxpayer in 2024. If you are preparing a return for someone who died in 2024, see Pub. 501 before completing the standard deduction information.

# Blindness

If you are married and file a joint return, you can be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return if you file the joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.

If you weren’t totally blind as of December 31, 2024, you must get a statement certified by your eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) that:

- You can't see better than 20/200 in your better eye with glasses or contact lenses, or
- Your field of vision is 20 degrees or less.

If your eye condition isn't likely to improve beyond the conditions listed above, you can get a statement certified by your eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) to this effect instead. You must keep the statement for your records.

If you receive a notice or letter but you would prefer to have it in Braille or large print, you can use Form 9000, Alternative Media Preference, to request notices in an alternative format including Braille, large print, audio, or electronic. You can attach Form 9000 to your return or mail it separately.

You can download, or view online, tax forms and publications in a variety of formats including text-only, Braille ready files, browser-friendly HTML (other than tax forms), accessible PDF, and large print.

# Married Filing Separately

If your filing status is married filing separately and your spouse itemizes deductions on their return, check the “Spouse itemizes on a separate return or you were a dual-status alien” box.

If your filing status is married filing separately and your spouse was born before January 2, 1960, or was blind at the end of 2024, you can check the appropriate box(es) on the line labeled “Age/Blindness” if your spouse had no income, isn't filing a return, and can't be claimed as a dependent on another person's return.

Death of spouse in 2024. If your spouse was born before January 2, 1960, but died in 2024 before reaching age 65, don’t check the box that says “Spouse was born before January 2, 1960.”

A person is considered to reach age 65 on the day before the person’s 65th birthday.

Example. Your spouse was born on February 14, 1959, and died on February 13, 2024. Your spouse is considered age 65 at the time of death. Check the appropriate box for your spouse. However, if your spouse died on February 12, 2024, your spouse isn't considered age 65.

# Definitions and Special Rules

at night, rules for a child who is emancipated under state law, and other details.

# Adopted child

An adopted child is always treated as your own child. An adopted child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption.

# Adoption taxpayer identification numbers (ATINs)

If you have a dependent who was placed with you for legal adoption and you don’t know the dependent’s SSN, you must get an ATIN for the dependent from the IRS. See Form W-7A for details. If the dependent isn't a U.S. citizen or resident alien, apply for an ITIN instead using Form W-7.

# Children of divorced or separated parents

A child will be treated as the qualifying child or qualifying relative of the child’s noncustodial parent (defined later) if all of the following conditions apply:

1. The parents are divorced, legally separated, separated under a written separation agreement, or lived apart at all times during the last 6 months of 2024 (whether or not they are or were married).
2. The child received over half of the child’s support for 2024 from the parents (and the rules on Multiple support agreements, later, don’t apply). Support of a child received from a parent's spouse is treated as provided by the parent.
3. The child is in custody of one or both of the parents for more than half of 2024.
4. Either of the following applies:
1. The custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement that they won't claim the child as a dependent for 2024, and the noncustodial parent includes a copy of the form or statement with their return. If the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial parent may be able to include certain pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. See Post-1984 and pre-2009 decree or agreement and Post-2008 decree or agreement.
2. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or written separation agreement between the parents provides that the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, and the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for support of the child during 2024.

If conditions (1) through (4) apply, only the noncustodial parent can claim the child for purposes of the child tax credits and credit for other dependents (lines 19 and 28). However, this doesn't allow the noncustodial parent to claim head of household filing status, the credit for child and dependent care expenses, the exclusion for dependent care benefits, or the earned income credit. The custodial parent or another taxpayer, if eligible, can claim the child for the earned income credit and these other benefits. See Pub. 501 for details.

# Custodial and noncustodial parents

The custodial parent is the parent with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights in 2024. The noncustodial parent is the other parent. If the child was with each parent for an equal number of nights, the custodial parent is the parent with the higher adjusted gross income. See Pub. 501 for an exception for a parent who works.

If the person meets all other requirements to be your qualifying child but was born or died in 2024, the person is considered to have lived with you for more than half of 2024 if your home was this person's home for more than half the time the person was alive in 2024. If the person meets all other requirements to be your qualifying child but you adopted the person in 2024, the

person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you

1. Child tax credit and credit for other dependents (line 19) and additional child tax credit (line 28).
2. Head of household filing status.
3. Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule 3, line 2).
4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part III).
5. Earned income credit (line 27).

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed based on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can claim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term "parent" means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual.

- If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent.
- If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents.
- If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time in 2024. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2024.
- If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2024.
- If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2024, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any parent of the child who can claim the child.

Multiple support agreements. If no one person contributed over half of the support of your relative (or a person who lived with you all year as a member of your household) but you and another person(s) provided more than half of your relative's support, special rules may apply that would treat you as having provided over half of the support. For details, see Pub. 501.

Permanently and totally disabled. A person is permanently and totally disabled if, at any time in 2024, the person can't engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condition has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least a year or can be expected to lead to death.

Public assistance payments. If you received payments under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program or other public assistance program and you used the money to support another person, see Pub. 501.

Qualifying child of more than one person. Even if a child meets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one person, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child for all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for Children of divorced or separated parents, described earlier, applies.

Social security number. You must enter each dependent's social security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered agree with the dependent's social security card. Otherwise, at the time we process your return, we may reduce or disallow any tax benefits (such as the child tax credit) based on that dependent. If the name or SSN on the dependent's social security card isn't correct or you need to get an SSN for your dependent, contact the Social Security Administration (SSA). See Social

Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov.
---
Security Number (SSN), earlier. If your dependent won't have a number by the date your return is due, see What if You Can't File on Time? earlier.

For the child tax credit, your child must have the required SSN. The required SSN is one that is valid for employment and that is issued by the SSA before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions). If your child was a U.S. citizen when the child received the SSN, the SSN is valid for employment. If “Not Valid for Employment” is printed on your child’s social security card and your child’s immigration status has changed so that your child is now a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, ask the SSA for a new social security card without the legend. However, if “Valid for Work Only With DHS Authorization” is printed on your child’s social security card, your child has the required SSN only as long as the DHS authorization is valid.

If your dependent child was born and died in 2024 and you do not have an SSN for the child, enter “Died” in column (2) of the Dependents section and include a copy of the child's birth certificate, death certificate, or hospital records. The document must show the child was born alive.

If you, or your spouse if filing jointly, didn't have an SSN (or ITIN) issued on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions), you can't claim the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents on your original or an amended 2024 return.

If you apply for an ITIN on or before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions) and the IRS issues you an ITIN as a result of the application, the IRS will consider your ITIN as issued on or before the due date of your return.

# Student

A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar months of 2024 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school or took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or a state, county, or local government agency.

# Foreign financial assets

If you had foreign financial assets in 2024, you may have to file Form 8938. See Form 8938 and its instructions.

# Income

Generally, you must report all income except income that is exempt from tax by law. For details, see the following instructions and the Schedule 1 instructions, especially the instructions for lines 1 through 7 and Schedule 1, lines 1 through 8z. Also see Pub. 525.

# Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases

If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case, income taxable to the bankruptcy estate and reported on the estate's income tax return includes:

- Earnings from services you performed after the beginning of the case (both wages and self-employment income); and
- Income from property described in section 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code that you either owned when the case began or that you acquired after the case began and before the case was closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under a different chapter.

Because this income is taxable to the estate, don’t include this income on your own individual income tax return. The only exception is for purposes of figuring your self-employment tax. For that purpose, you must take into account all your self-employment income for the year from services performed both before and after the beginning of the case. Also, you (or the trustee if one is appointed) must allocate between you and the bankruptcy estate the wages, salary, or other compensation and withheld income tax reported to you on Form W-2. A similar allocation is required for income and withheld income tax reported to you on Forms 1099.

# Rounding Off to Whole Dollars

You can round off cents to whole dollars on your return and schedules. If you do round to whole dollars, you must round all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3.

If you have to add two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, include cents when adding the amounts and round off only the total. If you are entering amounts that include cents, make sure to include the decimal point. There is no cents column on the form.

# Line 1a

Total Amount From Form(s) W-2, Box 1

Enter the total amount from Form(s) W-2, box 1. If a joint return, also include your spouse's income from Form(s) W-2, box 1.

If you earned wages while you were an inmate in a penal institution, report these amounts on Schedule 1, line 8u. Do not report these wages on line 1a. See the instructions for Schedule 1, line 8u.

# Community Property States

Community property states include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. If you and your spouse lived in a community property state, you must usually follow state law to determine what is community income and what is separate income. For details, see Form 8958 and Pub. 555.

# CAUTION

You can't deduct the amount deferred. It isn't included as income in box 1 of your Form W-2.

• Disability pensions shown on Form 1099-R if you haven’t reached the minimum retirement age set by your employer. But see Insurance Premiums for Retired Public Safety Officers in the instructions for lines 5a and 5b. Disability pensions received after you reach minimum retirement age and other payments shown on Form 1099-R (other than payments from an IRA) are reported on lines 5a and 5b. Payments from an IRA are reported on lines 4a and 4b.

# Line 2a

Tax-Exempt Interest

If you received any tax-exempt interest (including any tax-exempt original issue discount (OID)), such as from municipal bonds, each payer should send you a Form 1099-INT or a Form 1099-OID. In general, your tax-exempt stated interest should be shown in box 8 of Form 1099-INT or, for a tax-exempt OID bond, in box 2 of Form 1099-OID, and your tax-exempt OID should be shown in box 11 of Form 1099-OID. Enter the total on line 2a. However, if you acquired a tax-exempt bond at a premium, only report the net amount of tax-exempt interest on line 2a (that is, the excess of the tax-exempt interest received during the year over the amortized bond premium for the year). Also, if you acquired a tax-exempt OID bond at an acquisition premium, only report the net amount of tax-exempt OID on line 2a (that is, the excess of tax-exempt OID for the year over the amortized acquisition premium for the year). See Pub. 550 for more information about OID, bond premium, and acquisition premium.

# Line 3a

Qualified Dividends

Enter your total qualified dividends on line 3a. Qualified dividends are also included in the ordinary dividend total required to be shown on line 3b. Qualified dividends are eligible for a lower tax rate than other ordinary income. Generally, these dividends are shown in box 1b of Form(s) 1099-DIV. See Pub. 550 for the definition of qualified dividends if you received dividends not reported on Form 1099-DIV.

Exception. Some dividends may be reported as qualified dividends in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV but aren't qualified dividends. These include:

- Dividends you received as a nominee. See the Schedule B instructions.
- Dividends you received on any share of stock that you held for less than 61 days during the 121-day period that began 60 days before the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the purchaser of a stock isn't entitled to receive the next dividend payment. When counting the number of days you held the stock, include the day you disposed of the stock but not the day you acquired it. See the examples that follow.

# Line 2b

Taxable Interest

Each payer should send you a Form 1099-INT or Form 1099-OID. Enter your total taxable interest income on line 2b. But you must fill in and attach Schedule B if the total is over $1,500 or any of the other conditions listed at the end of the page.

Your employer is required to provide or send Form W-2 to you no later than January 31, 2025. If you don’t receive it by early February, use Tax Topic 154 to find out what to do.

held for less than 91 days during the a cash dividend of 10 cents a share. The bution from your IRA before income tax 181-day period that began 90 days be- ex-dividend date was July 16. The ABC Mutual Fund advises you that the part of the dividend eligible to be treated as qualified dividends equals 2 cents a share. Your Form 1099-DIV from ABC Mutual Fund shows total ordinary divi- dends of $1,000 and qualified dividends of $200. However, you sold the 10,000 shares on August 11. You have no quali- fied dividends from ABC Mutual Fund because you held the ABC Mutual Fund stock for less than 61 days.

Payments in lieu of dividends, but only if you know or have reason to know that the payments aren't qualified dividends.

Dividends from a corporation that first became a surrogate foreign corporation after December 22, 2017, other than a foreign corporation that is treated as a domestic corporation under section 7874(b).

# Example 1.

You bought 5,000 shares of XYZ Corp. common stock on July 8. XYZ Corp. paid a cash dividend of 10 cents per share. The ex-dividend date was July 16. Your Form 1099-DIV from XYZ Corp. shows $500 in box 1a (ordinary dividends) and in box 1b (qualified dividends). However, you sold the 5,000 shares on August 11. You held your shares of XYZ Corp. for only 34 days of the 121-day period (from July 9 through August 11). The 121-day period began on May 17 (60 days before the ex-dividend date) and ended on September 14. You have no qualified dividends from XYZ Corp. because you held the XYZ stock for less than 61 days.

# Example 2.

The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that you bought the stock on July 15 (the day before the ex-dividend date), and you sold the stock on September 16. You held the stock for 63 days (from July 16 through September 16). The $500 of qualified dividends shown in box 1b of Form 1099-DIV are all qualified dividends because you held the stock for 61 days of the 121-day period (from July 16 through September 14).

# Example 3.

You bought 10,000 shares of ABC Mutual Fund common stock on July 8. ABC Mutual Fund paid

# Line 3b

Ordinary Dividends

Enter your total ordinary div- idends on line 3b. This amount should be shown in box 1a of Form(s) 1099-DIV.

# Lines 4a and 4b

Exception 1. Enter the total distribution on line 4a if you rolled over part or all of the distribution from one:

- Roth IRA to another Roth IRA, or
- IRA (other than a Roth IRA) to a qualified plan or another IRA (other than a Roth IRA).

Also enter “Rollover” next to line 4b. If the total distribution was rolled over, enter -0- on line 4b. If the total distribution wasn't rolled over, enter the part not rolled over on line 4b unless Exception 2 applies to the part not rolled over. Generally, a rollover must be made within 60 days after the day you received the distribution. For more details on rollovers, see Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B.

If you rolled over the distribution into a qualified plan or you made the rollover in 2025, include a statement explaining what you did.

Exception 2. If any of the following apply, enter the total distribution on line 4a and see Form 8606 and its instructions to figure the amount to enter on line 4b.

1. You received a distribution from an IRA (other than a Roth IRA) and you made nondeductible contributions to any of your traditional IRAs for 2024 or an earlier year. If you made nondeductible contributions to these IRAs for 2024, also see Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B.
2. You received a distribution from a Roth IRA. But if either (a) or (b) below applies, enter -0- on line 4b; you don’t have to see Form 8606 or its instructions.

# IRA Distributions

You should receive a Form 1099-R showing the total amount of any distri- bution from your IRA before income tax or other deductions were withheld. This amount should be shown in box 1 of Form 1099-R. Unless otherwise noted in the line 4a and 4b instructions, an IRA includes a traditional IRA (which includes a traditional IRA that receives contributions from a simplified employee pension (SEP) arrangement), Roth IRA (which includes a Roth IRA that receives contributions from a SEP arrangement), and a SIMPLE IRA (a SIMPLE IRA may either be a traditional SIMPLE IRA or a Roth SIMPLE IRA).

For purposes of these Exceptions, Roth IRA includes a Roth SIMPLE IRA.

a. Distribution code T is shown in box 7 of Form 1099-R and you made a contribution (including a conversion) to a Roth IRA for 2018 or an earlier year.

b. Distribution code Q is shown in box 7 of Form 1099-R.

# 3. You converted part or all of a traditional IRA or traditional SIMPLE IRA to a Roth IRA in 2024.

4. You had a 2023 or 2024 IRA contribution returned to you, with the related earnings or less any loss, by the due date (including extensions) of your tax return for that year.

5. You made excess contributions to your IRA for an earlier year and had them returned to you in 2024.

6. You recharacterized part or all of a contribution to a Roth IRA as a contribution to a traditional IRA, or vice versa.

# Exception 3.

If all or part of the distribution is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), enter the total distribution on line 4a. If the total amount distributed is a QCD, enter -0- on line 4b. If only part of the distribution is a QCD, enter the part that is not a QCD on line 4b unless Exception 2 applies to that part. Enter “QCD” next to line 4b.

A QCD is a distribution made directly by the trustee of your IRA (other than an ongoing SEP or SIMPLE IRA) to an organization eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions (with certain exceptions). You must have been at least age 70 1/2 when the distribution was made.

Generally, your total QCDs for the year can't be more than $105,000. This includes any amount (up to $53,000) of a one-time QCD to a split-interest entity (SIE). If you file a joint return, the same rules apply to your spouse. The amount of the QCD is limited to the amount that would otherwise be included in your income. If your IRA includes nondeductible contributions, the distribution is first considered to be paid out of otherwise taxable income. If you make the one-time QCD to an SIE, you must attach a statement to your return. See Pub. 590-B for details on QCDs, including the information you must include on the attachment for QCDs to an SIE.

# More than one exception applies.

If more than one exception applies, include a statement showing the amount of each exception, instead of making an entry next to line 4b. For example: “Line 4b – $1,000 Rollover and $500 HFD.” But you don’t need to attach a statement if only Exception 2 and one other exception apply.

# More than one distribution.

If you (or your spouse if filing jointly) received more than one distribution, figure the taxable amount of each distribution and enter the total of the taxable amounts on line 4b. Enter the total amount of those distributions on line 4a.

# Pensions and Annuities

You should receive a Form 1099-R showing the total amount of your pension and annuity payments before income tax or other deductions were withheld. This amount should be shown in box 1 of Form 1099-R. Pension and annuity payments include distributions from 401(k), 403(b), and governmental 457(b) plans. Rollovers and lump-sum distributions are explained later. Don’t include the following payments on lines 5a and 5b. Instead, report them on line 1h.

- Disability pensions received before you reach the minimum retirement age set by your employer.
- Corrective distributions (including any earnings) of excess elective deferrals or other excess contributions to retirement plans. The plan must advise you of the year(s) the distributions are includible in income.

# Attach Form(s) 1099-R to Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any federal income tax was withheld.

# Fully Taxable Pensions and Annuities

Your payments are fully taxable if (a) you didn't contribute to the cost (see Cost, later) of your pension or annuity, or (b) you got your entire cost back tax free before 2024. But see Insurance Pre-

# Pensions and Annuities

# Fully Taxable Pensions and Annuities

If your pension or annuity is fully taxable, enter the total pension or annuity payments (from Form(s) 1099-R, box 1) on line 5b; don’t make an entry on line 5a.

Fully taxable pensions and annuities also include military retirement pay shown on Form 1099-R. For details on military disability pensions, see Pub. 525. If you received a Form RRB-1099-R, see Pub. 575 to find out how to report your benefits.

# Partially Taxable Pensions and Annuities

Enter the total pension or annuity payments (from Form 1099-R, box 1) on line 5a. If your Form 1099-R doesn't show the taxable amount, you must use the General Rule explained in Pub. 939 to figure the taxable part to enter on line 5b. But if your annuity starting date (defined later) was after July 1, 1986, see Simplified Method, later, to find out if you must use that method to figure the taxable part.

You can ask the IRS to figure the taxable part for you for a $1,000 fee. For details, see Pub. 939.

If your Form 1099-R shows a taxable amount, you can report that amount on line 5b. But you may be able to report a lower taxable amount by using the General Rule or the Simplified Method or if the exclusion for retired public safety officers, discussed next, applies.

# Insurance Premiums for Retired Public Safety Officers

If you are an eligible retired public safety officer (law enforcement officer, firefighter, chaplain, or member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew who is retired because of disability or because you reached normal retirement age), you can elect to exclude from income distributions made from your eligible retirement plan that are used to pay the premiums for coverage by an accident or health plan or a long-term care insurance contract. The premiums can be for coverage for you, your spouse, or dependents. The distribution must be from the plan maintained by the employer from which you retired as a public safety officer. The distribution can be made directly from the plan to the provider of the accident or health plan or long-term care insurance contract, or the distribution can be made to you to pay to the provider of the accident or health plan or long-term care insurance contract.

You can exclude from income the smaller of the amount of the premiums paid or $3,000. You can make this election only for amounts that would otherwise be included in your income. The amount excluded from your income can’t be used to claim a medical expense deduction.

An eligible retirement plan is a governmental plan that is a qualified trust or a section 403(a), 403(b), or 457(b) plan.

CAUTION: You can exclude from income only the smaller of the amount of the premiums paid or $3,000. This is true if the distribution was made directly from the plan to the provider of the accident or health plan or long-term care insurance contract or if the distribution was made to you and you paid the provider of the accident or health plan or long-term care insurance contract.

If you received a distribution from your eligible retirement plan, and you used part of that distribution to pay premiums for an accident or health plan or long-term care insurance contract, you can still exclude from income only the smaller of the amount of the premiums paid or $3,000. The rest of the distribution is taxable to you and must be reported on line 5b.

If you make this election, reduce the otherwise taxable amount of your pension or annuity by the amount excluded. The amount shown in box 2a of Form 1099-R doesn't reflect the exclusion. Report your total distributions on line 5a and the taxable amount on line 5b. Enter “PSO” next to line 5b.

If you are retired on disability and reporting your disability pension on line 1h, include only the taxable amount on that line and enter “PSO” and the amount excluded on the dotted line next to line 1h.

# Simplified Method

You must use the Simplified Method if either of the following applies:

1. Your annuity starting date was after July 1, 1986, and you used this method last year to figure the taxable part.
2. Your annuity starting date was after November 18, 1996, and both of the following apply:
1. The payments are from a qualified employee plan, a qualified employee annuity, or a tax-sheltered annuity.
2. On your annuity starting date, either you were under age 75 or the number of years of guaranteed payments was fewer than 5. See Pub. 575 for the definition of guaranteed payments.

You must include in your income any amounts that you received that you did not treat as disability payments. The payments must be reported as a pension or annuity.

If you must use the Simplified Method, complete the Simplified Method Worksheet in these instructions to figure the taxable part of your pension or annuity. For more details on the Simplified Method, see Pub. 575 (or Pub. 721 for U.S. Civil Service retirement benefits).

If you received U.S. Civil Service retirement benefits and you chose the alternative annuity option, see Pub. 721 to figure the taxable part of your annuity. Do not use the Simplified Method Worksheet in these instructions.

CAUTION

Enter on line 5a the distribution from Form 1099-R, box 1. From this amount, subtract any contributions (usually shown in box 5) that were taxable to you when made. From that result, subtract the amount of the rollover. Enter the remaining amount on line 5b. If the remaining amount is zero and you have no other distribution to report on line 5b, enter -0- on line 5b. Also enter "Rollover" next to line 5b.

Also, if your total repayments in 2024 exceed your total benefits received in 2024 by more than $3,000, you may be able to take an itemized deduction or a credit for part of the excess repayments if they were for benefits you included in income in an earlier year. For more details, see Pub. 915.

Your annuity starting date is the later of the first day of the first period for which you received a payment or the date the plan's obligations became fixed.

# Annuity Starting Date

If you are the retiree, use your age on the annuity starting date. If you are the survivor of a retiree, use the retiree's age on their annuity starting date. But if your annuity starting date was after 1997 and the payments are for your life and that of your beneficiary, use your combined ages on the annuity starting date.

If you are the beneficiary of an employee who died, see Pub. 575. If there is more than one beneficiary, see Pub. 575 or Pub. 721 to figure each beneficiary's taxable amount.

# Lump-Sum Distributions

If you received a lump-sum distribution from a profit-sharing or retirement plan, your Form 1099-R should have the "Total distribution" box in box 2b checked. You may owe an additional tax if you received an early distribution from a qualified retirement plan and the total amount wasn't rolled over. For details, see the instructions for Schedule 2, line 8.

# Social Security Benefits

Your cost is generally your net investment in the plan as of the annuity starting date. It doesn't include pre-tax contributions. Your net investment may be shown in box 9b of Form 1099-R.

Generally, a rollover is a tax-free distribution of cash or other assets from one retirement plan that is contributed to another plan within 60 days of receiving the distribution. However, a rollover to a Roth IRA or a designated Roth account is generally not a tax-free distribution. Use lines 5a and 5b to report a rollover, including a direct rollover, from one qualified employer's plan to another or to an IRA.

Exception. Do not use the Social Security Benefits Worksheet in these instructions if any of the following applies:

- You made contributions to a traditional IRA for 2024 and you or your spouse were covered by a retirement plan at work or through self-employment. Instead, use the worksheets in Pub. 590-A to see if any of your social security benefits are taxable and to figure your IRA deduction.
- You file Form 2555, 4563, or 8815, or you exclude employer-provided adoption benefits or income from sources within Puerto Rico. Instead, use the worksheet in Pub. 915.

Social security beneficiaries can now get a variety of information from the SSA website with a my Social Security account, including getting a replacement Form SSA-1099 if needed. For more information and to set up an account, go to SSA.gov/myaccount.

Disability payments. Don’t include in your income any disability payments (including Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments) you receive for injuries incurred as a direct result of a terrorist attack directed against the United States (or its allies), whether outside or within the United States. In the case of the September 11 attacks, injuries eligible for coverage by the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund are treated as incurred as a direct result of the attack. If these payments are incorrectly reported as taxable on Form SSA-1099, don't include the nontaxable portion of income on your tax return.

For more information about these payments, see Pub. 3920.

Example: You were a firefighter who was disabled as a direct result of the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. You began receiving SSDI benefits at age 54. Your full retirement age for social security retirement...

ment benefits is age 66. Your birthday is Exception 2. You must file Schedule D April 25. In the year you turned age 66, you received $1,500 per month in bene- fits from the SSA (for a total of $18,000 for the year). Because you became eligi- ble for a full retirement benefit in May, the month after you turned age 66, you can exclude only 4 months (January through April) of your annual benefit from income ($6,000). You must report the remaining $12,000 on line 6a. You must also complete the Social Security Benefits Worksheet to find out if any part of the $12,000 is taxable.

# Tax and Credits

Form RRB-1099. If you need a replacement Form RRB-1099, call the Railroad Retirement Board at 877-772-5772 or go to www.rrb.gov.

Accrued leave payment. If you retire on disability, any lump-sum payment you receive for accrued annual leave is a salary payment. The payment is not a disability payment. Include it in your income in the tax year you receive it.

# Line 12

Itemized Deductions or Standard Deduction In most cases, your federal income tax will be less if you take the larger of your itemized deductions or standard deduction.

# Itemized Deductions

To figure your itemized deductions, fill in Schedule A.

If you made a section 962 election and are taking a deduction under section 250 with respect to any income inclusions under section 951A, don't report the deduction on line 12. Instead, report the tax with respect to a section 962 election on line 16 and include in the statement required by line 16 how you figured the section 250 deduction.

# Line 6c

Check the box on line 6c if you elect to use the lump-sum election method for your benefits. If any of your benefits are taxable for 2024 and they include a lump-sum benefit payment that was for an earlier year, you may be able to reduce the taxable amount with the lump-sum election. See Lump-Sum Election in Pub. 915 for details.

# Line 7

Capital Gain or (Loss) If you sold a capital asset, such as a stock or bond, you must complete and attach Form 8949 and Schedule D.

Exception 1. You don’t have to file Form 8949 or Schedule D if you aren’t deferring any capital gain by investing in a qualified opportunity fund and both of the following apply.

1. You have no capital losses, and your only capital gains are capital gain distributions from Form(s) 1099-DIV, box 2a (or substitute statements); and
2. None of the Form(s) 1099-DIV (or substitute statements) have an amount in box 2b (unrecaptured section 1250 gain), box 2c (section 1202 gain), or box 2d (collectibles (28%) gain).

       (whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then, complete lines 5 and 6 above.
       These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.

                   or line 9 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.
                2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 2 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet
                   or line 6 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1) above.
                3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.
                4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D
                   (Form 1040).

Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents

See Schedule 8812 (Form 1040) and its instructions for information on figuring and claiming any child tax credit and credit for other dependents that you may qualify to claim.

Form 8862, who must file. You must file Form 8862 to claim the child tax credit or credit for other dependents if your child tax credit (refundable or non-refundable depending on the tax year), additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents for a year after 2015 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical error. Attach a completed Form 8862 to your 2024 return to claim the credit for 2024. Don’t file Form 8862 if you filed Form 8862 for 2023, and the child tax credit, additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents was allowed for that year. See Form 8862 and its instructions for details.

If you claim the child tax credit or credit for other dependents even though you aren't eligible and it is determined that your error is due to reckless or intentional disregard of the rules for these credits, you won't be allowed to take either credit or the additional child tax credit for 2 years even if you're otherwise eligible to do so.

CAUTION

If you claim the child tax credit or credit for other dependents even though you aren’t eligible and it is later determined that you fraudulently claimed either credit, you won't be allowed to take either credit or the additional child tax credit for 10 years. You may also have to pay penalties.

If your qualifying child didn’t have an SSN valid for employment issued before the due date of your 2024 return (including extensions), you can’t claim the child tax credit for that child on your original or amended return. However, you may be able to claim the credit for other dependents for that child.

# Federal Income Tax Withheld

# 2024 Estimated Tax Payments

Line 25a—Form(s) W-2 Enter any estimated federal income tax payments you made for 2024. Include any overpayment that you applied to your 2024 estimated tax from your 2023 return or an amended return (Form 1040-X).

Add the amounts shown as federal income tax withheld on your Form(s) W-2. Enter the total on line 25a. The amount withheld should be shown in box 2 of Form W-2. Attach your Form(s) W-2 to your return.

Line 25b—Form(s) 1099 Include on line 25b any federal income tax withheld on your Form(s) 1099-R. The amount withheld should be shown in box 4. Attach your Form(s) 1099-R to the front of your return if federal income tax was withheld.

If you and your spouse paid joint estimated tax but are now filing separate income tax returns, you can divide the amount paid in any way you choose as long as you both agree. If you can't agree, you must divide the payments in proportion to each spouse's individual tax as shown on your separate returns for 2024. For more information, see Pub. 505. Be sure to show both SSNs in the space provided on the separate returns.

If you or your spouse paid separate estimated tax but you are now filing a joint return, add the amounts you each paid. Follow these instructions even if your spouse died in 2024 or in 2025 before filing a 2024 return.

Divorced taxpayers. If you got divorced in 2024 and you made joint estimated tax payments with your former spouse, enter your former spouse's SSN in the space provided on the front of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you were divorced and remarried in 2024, enter your present spouse's SSN in the space provided on the front of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Also, on the dotted line next to line 26, enter your former spouse's SSN, followed by “DIV.”

Name change. If you changed your name and you made estimated tax payments using your former name, attach a statement to the front of Form 1040 or 1040-SR that explains all the payments you and your spouse made in 2024 and the name(s) and SSN(s) under which you made them.

# Earned Income Credit (EIC)

Yes. Continue

No. STOP

What Is the EIC?

The EIC is a credit for certain people who work. The credit may give you a refund even if you don’t owe any tax or didn’t have any tax withheld.

# To Take the EIC:

- Follow the steps below.
- Complete the worksheet that applies to you or let the IRS figure the credit for you.
- If you have at least one child who meets the conditions to be your qualifying child for purposes of claiming the EIC, complete and attach Schedule EIC, even if that child doesn't have a valid SSN. See Schedule EIC for more information, including how to complete Schedule EIC if your qualifying child doesn't have a valid SSN.

For help in determining if you are eligible for the EIC, go to IRS.gov/EITC and click on “Check if You Qualify.” This service is available in English and Spanish.

# CAUTION

If you claim the EIC even though you aren't eligible and it is determined that your error is due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, you won't be allowed to take the credit for 2 years even if you are otherwise eligible to do so. If you fraudulently claim the EIC, you won't be allowed to take the credit for 10 years. See Form 8862, who must file, later. You may also have to pay penalties.

that was also reported on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1z, do the following.

1. Enter “Clergy” on the dotted line next to line 27.
2. Determine how much of the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1z, was also reported on Schedule SE, Part I, line 2.

4. Be sure to answer “Yes” to question 2 in Step 5.

# Combat pay, nontaxable.

If you were a member of the U.S. Armed Forces who served in a combat zone, certain pay is excluded from your income. See Combat Zone Exclusion in Pub. 3. You can elect to include this pay in your earned income when figuring the EIC. The amount of your nontaxable combat pay should be shown in box 12 of Form(s) W-2 with code Q. If you are filing a joint return and both you and your spouse received nontaxable combat pay, you can each make your own election. In other words, if one of you makes the election, the other one can also make it but doesn't have to.

If you elect to use your nontaxable combat pay in figuring your EIC, enter that amount on line 1i.

# CAUTION

Credit figured by the IRS. To have the IRS figure your EIC:

1. Enter “EIC” on the dotted line next to line 27.
2. Be sure you enter the nontaxable combat pay you elect to include in earned income by entering that amount on line 1i. See Combat pay, nontaxable, earlier.
3. If you have a qualifying child, complete and attach Schedule EIC. If your EIC for a year after 1996 was reduced or disallowed, see Form 8862, who must file, later.

# Exception to time lived with you.

Temporary absences by you or the child for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juvenile facility, count as time the child lived with you. Also see Kidnapped child under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, earlier, and Members of the military, later. A child is considered to have lived with you for more than half of 2024 if the child was born or died in 2024 and your home was this child's home for more than half the time the child was alive in 2024 or if you adopted the child in 2024, the child was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2024, or the child was an eligible foster child placed with you during 2024 and your main home was the child's main home for more than half the time since the child was adopted or placed with you in 2024.

# Form 4797 filers.

If the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 7, includes an amount from Form 4797, you must use Worksheet 1 in Pub. 596 to see if you can take the EIC. Otherwise, stop; you can't take the EIC.

# Form 8862, who must file.

You must file Form 8862 if your EIC for a year after 1996 was reduced or disallowed for any reason other than a math or clerical error. But don’t file Form 8862 if either of the following applies.

- You filed Form 8862 for another year, the EIC was allowed for that year, and your EIC hasn't been reduced or disallowed again for any reason other than a math or clerical error.
- You are taking the EIC without a qualifying child and the only reason your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the other year was because it was determined that a child listed on Schedule EIC wasn't your qualifying child.

Also, don’t file Form 8862 or take the credit for the:

- 2 years after the most recent tax year for which there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, or
- 10 years after the most recent tax year for which there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to fraud.

# Foster child.

A foster child is any child placed with you by an authorized placement agency or by judgment, decree, or other order of any court of competent jurisdiction. For more details on authorized placement agencies, see Pub. 596.

# Main home.

Your main home may be your house, apartment, mobile home, shelter, temporary lodging, or other location and doesn't need to be the same physical location throughout 2024. You don't need a permanent address.

# Married child.

A child who was married at the end of 2024 is a qualifying child only if (a) you can claim the child as your dependent except for the special rule for Children of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, earlier, or (b) you could have claimed the child as your dependent.

# Members of the military.

If you were on extended active duty outside the United States, your main home is considered to be in the United States during that duty period. Extended active duty is military duty ordered for an indefinite period or for a period of more than 90 days. Once you begin serving extended active duty, you are considered to be on extended active duty even if you don’t serve more than 90 days.

# Nonresident aliens.

If you checked the box in the Filing Status section to treat a nonresident alien or dual-status alien spouse as a U.S. resident for the entire year, go to Step 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't take the EIC. Enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27. See Nonresident aliens and dual-status aliens, earlier.

# Permanently and totally disabled.

A person is permanently and totally disabled if, at any time in 2024, the person couldn't engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condition (a) has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least a year, or (b) can be expected to lead to death.

# Qualifying child of more than one person.

Even if a child meets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one person, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child for all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for Children of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, earlier, applies.

1. Child tax credit, credit for other dependents, and additional child tax credit (lines 19 and 28).
2. Head of household filing status.
3. Credit for child and dependent care expenses (Schedule 3, line 2).

Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov.
---
# 4. Exclusion for dependent care benefits (Form 2441, Part III).

# 5. Earned income credit (line 27).

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed based on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can claim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. For purposes of these rules, the term “parent” means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual.

- If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent.
- If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents.
- If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time in 2024. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2024.
- If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2024.
- If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent does so, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2024, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any parent of the child who can claim the child.

TIP: If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a qualifying child for the EIC, you may be able to claim the EIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying child. For more information, see Pub. 596.

Example: Your child, Lee, meets the conditions to be a qualifying child for both you and your parent. Lee doesn't meet the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including Lee’s other parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim Lee as a qualifying child for all of the five tax benefits listed here for which you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the five tax benefits listed here based on Lee. However, if your parent’s AGI is higher than yours and you don’t claim Lee as a qualifying child, Lee is the qualifying child of your parent.

Student. A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar months of 2024 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school or took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or a state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a technical, trade, or mechanical school. It doesn't include an on-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school offering courses only through the Internet.

Welfare benefits, effect of credit on. Any refund you receive as a result of taking the EIC can't be counted as income when determining if you or anyone else is eligible for benefits or assistance, or how much you or anyone else can receive, under any federal program or under any state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds. These programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps). In addition, when determining eligibility, the refund can't be counted as a resource for at least 12 months after you receive it. Check with your local benefit coordinator to find out if your refund will affect your benefits.

# Refund Offset

# Additional Child Tax Credit

See Schedule 8812 (Form 1040) and its instructions for information on figuring and claiming any additional child tax credit that you may qualify to claim. If you are claiming the additional child tax credit, complete Schedule 8812 and attach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

Form 8862, who must file. You must file Form 8862 to claim the additional child tax credit if your child tax credit (refundable or nonrefundable depending on the tax year), additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents for a year after 2015 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical error. Attach a completed Form 8862 to your 2024 return to claim the credit for 2024. Don't file Form 8862 if you filed Form 8862 for 2023 and the child tax credit, additional child tax credit, or credit for other dependents was allowed for that year. See Form 8862 and its instructions for details.

CAUTION If you claim the additional child tax credit even though you aren't eligible and it is determined that your error is due to reckless or intentional disregard of the additional child tax credit rules, you won't be allowed to take the child tax credit, the credit for other dependents, or the additional child tax credit for 2 years even if you’re otherwise eligible to do so. If you claim the additional child tax credit even though you aren’t eligible and it is later determined that you fraudulently claimed the credit, you won't be allowed to take the child tax credit, the credit for other dependents, or the additional child tax credit for 10 years. You may also have to pay penalties.

# American Opportunity Credit

If you meet the requirements to claim an education credit (see the instructions for Schedule 3, line 3), enter on line 29 the amount, if any, from Form 8863, line 8. You may be able to increase an education credit and reduce your total tax or increase your tax refund if the student chooses to include all or part of a Pell grant or certain other scholarships or fellowships in income. See Pub. 970 and the Instructions for Form 8863 for more information.

Form 8862 required. You must file Form 8862 to claim the American opportunity credit if your American opportunity credit for a year after 2015 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical error. Attach a completed Form 8862 to your 2024 return to claim the credit for 2024. Don't file Form 8862 if you filed Form 8862 for 2023 and the American opportunity credit was allowed for that year. See Form 8862 and its instructions for details.

# Deposit Refund Into Multiple Accounts

If you want your refund to be split and direct deposited into more than one account, file Form 8888. Use Form 8888 to direct deposit your refund (or part of it) to one or more accounts in your name at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United States.

# Injured Spouse

If you file a joint return and your spouse hasn’t paid past-due federal tax, state income tax, state unemployment compensation debts, child support, spousal support, or a federal nontax debt, such as a student loan, part or all of the overpayment on line 34 may be used (offset) to pay the past-due amount. But your part of the overpayment may be refunded to you if certain conditions apply and you complete Form 8379. For details, see Form 8379.

# Lines 35a Through 35d

# Amount Refunded to You

If you want to check the status of your refund, just use the IRS2Go app or go to IRS.gov/Refunds. See Refund Information, later. Information about your refund will generally be available within 24 hours after the IRS receives your e-filed return, or 4 weeks after you mail your paper return. If you filed Form 8379 with your return, wait 14 weeks (11 weeks if you filed electronically).

# Line 30

Line 30 has been reserved for future use.

# Line 34

# Amount Overpaid

If line 34 is under $1, we will send a refund only on written request.

Have your 2024 tax return handy so you can enter your social security number, your filing status, and the exact whole dollar amount of your refund.

Where's My Refund will provide a personalized refund date as soon as the IRS processes your tax return and approves your refund.

# Claiming a refund for a deceased taxpayer.

If you are filing a joint return with your deceased spouse, you only need to file the tax return to claim the refund. If you are a court-appointed representative, file the return and include a copy of the certificate that shows your appointment. All other filers requesting the deceased taxpayer's refund must file the return and attach Form 1310.

# Effect of refund on benefits.

Any refund you receive can't be counted as income when determining if you or anyone else is eligible for benefits or assistance, or how much you or anyone else can receive, under any federal program or under any state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds. These programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps). In addition, when determining eligibility, the refund can't be counted as a resource for at least 12 months after you receive it. Check with your local benefit coordinator to find out if your refund will affect your benefits.

# Why Use Direct Deposit?

- You get your refund faster by direct deposit than you do by check.
- Payment is more secure. There is no check that can get lost or stolen.
- It is more convenient. You don’t have to make a trip to the bank to deposit your check.
- It saves tax dollars. It costs the government less to refund by direct deposit.
- It's proven itself. Nearly 98% of social security and veterans' benefits are sent electronically using direct deposit.

# Form 8888.

You can have your refund directly deposited into more than one account. For more information, see the Form 8888 instructions.

# DIRECT DEPOSIT

Simple. Safe. Secure. Fast Refunds! Join the eight in 10 taxpayers who choose direct deposit—a fast, simple, safe, secure way to have your refund deposited automatically to your checking or savings account, including an individual retirement arrangement (IRA). See the information about IRAs, later.

# Line 35b

The routing number must be nine digits. The first two digits must be 01 through 12 or 21 through 32. On the sample check shown later, the routing number is 250250025. C. and M. Keys would use that routing number unless their financial institution instructed them to use a different routing number for direct deposits.

Ask your financial institution for the correct routing number to enter on line 35b if:

- The routing number on a deposit slip is different from the routing number on your checks,
- Your deposit is to a savings account that doesn't allow you to write checks, or

If you want us to directly deposit the amount shown on line 35a to your checking, savings, health savings, brokerage or other similar account, including an IRA, at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United States:

- Complete lines 35b through 35d (if you want your refund deposited to only one account), or

Account must be in your name. Don’t request a deposit of your refund to an account that isn't in your name, such as your tax return preparer’s account. Although you may owe your tax return preparer a fee for preparing your return, don’t have any part of your refund deposited into
---
Your checks state they are payable through a financial institution different from the one at which you have your checking account.

# Sample Check—Lines 35b Through 35d

|C. KEYS|M. KEYS|
|---|---|
|123 Pear Lane|15-0000/0000|
|Anyplace, MI 00000| |

Check the appropriate box for the type of account. Don’t check more than one box. If the deposit is to an account such as an IRA, health savings account, brokerage account, or other similar account, ask your financial institution whether you should check the “Checking” or “Savings” box. You must check the correct box to ensure your deposit is accepted.

The routing and account numbers may be in different places on your check.

# Line 35c

The account number can be up to 17 characters (both numbers and letters). Include hyphens but omit spaces and special symbols. Enter the number from left to right and leave any unused boxes blank. On the sample check shown later, the account number is 20202086. Don’t include the check number.

If the direct deposit to your account(s) is different from the amount you expected, you will receive an explanation in the mail about 2 weeks after your refund is deposited.

# Reasons Your Direct Deposit Request Will Be Rejected

If any of the following apply, your direct deposit request will be rejected and a check will be sent instead.

- You are asking to have a joint refund deposited to an individual account, and your financial institution(s) won't allow this. The IRS isn't responsible if a financial institution rejects a direct deposit.
- The name on your account doesn't match the name on the refund, and your financial institution(s) won't allow a refund to be deposited unless the name on the refund matches the name on the account.
- Three direct deposits of tax refunds already have been made to the same account or prepaid debit card.
- You haven't given a valid account number.
- Any numbers or letters on lines 35b through 35d are crossed out or whited out.

# CAUTION

The IRS isn't responsible for a lost refund if you enter the wrong account information.

# Amount You Owe

To avoid interest and penalties, pay your taxes in full by the due date of your return (not including extensions)—April 15, 2025, for most taxpayers. You don’t have to pay if line 37 is under $1.

# Line 36

Enter on line 36 the amount, if any, of the overpayment on line 34 you want applied to your 2025 estimated tax. We will apply this amount to your account unless you include a statement requesting us to apply it to your spouse's account. Include your spouse's social security number in the statement.

This election to apply part or all of the amount overpaid to your 2025 estimated tax can't be changed later.

Include any estimated tax penalty from line 38 in the amount you enter on line 37. Don’t include any estimated payments for 2025 in this payment. Instead, make the estimated payment separately.

The penalty for writing a bad check to the IRS is $25 or 2% of the check, whichever is more. However, if the amount of the check is less than $25, the penalty equals the amount of the check. This also applies to other forms of payment if the IRS doesn’t receive the funds. Use Tax Topic 206.

# Line 37

The IRS offers several payment options. You can pay online, by phone, mobile device, cash, check, or money order. Go to IRS.gov/Payments for payment options.

# Pay Online

Paying online is convenient and secure and helps make sure we get your payments on time. To pay your taxes online or for more information, go to IRS.gov/

# Payments

You can pay using any of the following methods.

- Your Online Account. You can make tax payments through your online account, including balance payments, estimated tax payments, or other types. You can also see your payment history and other tax records there. Go to IRS.gov/Account.
- IRS Direct Pay. For online transfers directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you, go to IRS.gov/Payments.
- Pay by Card or Digital Wallet. To pay by debit or credit card, or digital wallet, go to IRS.gov/Payments. A fee is charged by these service providers. You can also pay by phone with a debit or credit card. See Debit or credit card under Pay by Phone, later.
- Electronic Funds Withdrawal (EFW) is an integrated e-file/e-pay option offered when filing your federal taxes electronically using tax return preparation software, through a tax professional, or the IRS at IRS.gov/Payments.
- Online Payment Agreement. If you can’t pay in full by the due date of your tax return, you can apply for an online monthly installment agreement at IRS.gov/OPA. Once you complete the online process, you will receive immediate notification of whether your agreement has been approved. A user fee is charged.
- Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). Allows you to pay your taxes online or by phone directly from your checking or savings account. There is no fee for this service. You must be enrolled either online or have an enrollment form mailed to you. See EFTPS under Pay by Phone, later.
- Pay by Mobile Device. To pay through your mobile device, download the IRS2Go app.
- Pay by Cash. You can pay your taxes in cash. To find out about the different cash payment methods, go to IRS.gov/PayCash. Don’t send cash payments through the mail.
- Pay by Check or Money Order. Before submitting a payment through the mail, please consider alternative methods. One of our safe, quick, and easy electronic payment options might be right for you. If you choose to mail a tax payment, make your check or money order payable to “United States Treasury” for the full amount due. Don’t send cash. Don’t attach the payment to your return. Write “2024 Form 1040” or “2024 Form 1040-SR” and your name, address, daytime phone number, and social security number (SSN) on your payment and attach Form 1040-V.

# What if You Can't Pay?

If you can't pay the full amount shown on line 37 when you file, you can ask for:

- An installment agreement, or
- An extension of time to pay.

# Installment agreement.

Under an installment agreement, you can pay all or part of the tax you owe in monthly installments. However, even if an installment agreement is granted, you will be charged interest and may be charged a late payment penalty on the tax not paid by the due date of your return (not counting extensions)—April 15, 2025, for most people. You must also pay a fee. To limit the interest and penalty charges, pay as much of the tax as possible when you file. But before requesting an installment agreement, you should consider other less costly alternatives, such as a bank loan or credit card payment.

Mail your 2024 tax return, payment, and Form 1040-V to the address shown.

Need more information or forms? Visit IRS.gov.
---
# To ask for an installment agreement,

you can apply online or use Form 9465. To apply online, go to IRS.gov/OPA.

# Extension of time to pay.

If paying the tax when it is due would cause you an undue hardship, you can ask for an extension of time to pay by filing Form 1127 by the due date of your return (not counting extensions)—April 15, 2025, for most people. An extension generally won't be granted for more than 6 months. You will be charged interest on the tax not paid by April 15, 2025. You must pay the tax before the extension runs out. If you do not pay the tax by the extended due date, penalties and interest will be imposed until taxes are paid in full. For the most up-to-date information on Form 1127, go to IRS.gov/Form1127.

# Line 38

# Estimated Tax Penalty

You may owe this penalty if:

- Line 37 is at least $1,000 and it is more than 10% of the tax shown on your return, or
- You didn't pay enough estimated tax by any of the due dates. This is true even if you are due a refund.

For most people, the “tax shown on your return” is the amount on your 2024 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 24, minus the total of any amounts shown on lines 27, 28, and 29; Schedule 3, lines 9 and 12; and Forms 8828, 4137, 5329 (Parts III through IX only), and 8919. Also subtract from line 24 any:

- Tax on an excess parachute payment,
- Excise tax on insider stock compensation of an expatriated corporation,
- Uncollected social security and Medicare or RRTA tax on tips or group-term life insurance, and
- Look-back interest due under section 167(g) or 460(b).

If you want to allow your preparer, a friend, a family member, or any other person you choose to discuss your 2024 tax return with the IRS, check the “Yes” box in the “Third Party Designee” area of your return. Also enter the designee's name, phone number, and any five digits the designee chooses as their personal identification number (PIN).

If you check the “Yes” box, you, and your spouse if filing a joint return, are authorizing the IRS to call the designee to answer any questions that may arise during the processing of your return. You are also authorizing the designee to:

- Give the IRS any information that is missing from your return;
- Call the IRS for information about the processing of your return or the status of your refund or payment(s);
- Receive copies of notices or transcripts related to your return, upon request; and
- Respond to certain IRS notices about math errors, offsets, and return preparation.

You aren't authorizing the designee to receive any refund check, bind you to anything (including any additional tax liability), or otherwise represent you before the IRS. If you want to expand the designee's authorization, see Pub. 947.

This authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (not counting extensions) for filing your 2025 tax return. This is April 15, 2026, for most people.

# Sign Your Return

Form 1040 or 1040-SR isn't considered a valid return unless you sign it in accordance with the requirements in these instructions. If you are filing a joint return, your spouse must also sign. If your spouse can't sign the return, see Pub. 501. Be sure to date your return and enter your occupation(s). If you have someone prepare your return, you are still responsible for the correctness of the return. If your return is signed by a representative for you, you must have a power of attorney attached that specifically authorizes the representative to sign your return. To do this, you can use Form 2848. If you are filing a joint return with your spouse who died in 2024, see Death of a Taxpayer, earlier.

# Self-Select PIN

The Self-Select PIN method allows you to create your own PIN. If you are married filing jointly, you and your spouse will each need to create a PIN and enter these PINs as your electronic signatures.

A PIN is any combination of five digits you choose except five zeros. If you use a PIN, there are no papers to sign and nothing to mail—not even your Form(s) W-2.

# Child's Return

If your child can't sign their return, either parent can sign the child's name in the space provided. Then, enter “By (your signature), parent for minor child.”

# Requirements for a Paper Return

You must handwrite your signature on your return if you file it on paper. Digital, electronic, or typed-font signatures are not valid signatures for Forms 1040 or 1040-SR filed on paper.

# Requirements for an Electronic Return

The requirements for signing an electronic return will be different depending on whether you use tax software or a tax practitioner. If you are filing electronically using Direct File, you should follow the instructions provided to you by Direct File for how to sign your electronic return. Otherwise, to file your return electronically, you must sign the return electronically using a personal identification number (PIN) and provide the information described below. If you are filing online using software, you must use a Self-Select PIN. If you are filing electronically using a tax practitioner, you can use a Self-Select PIN or a Practitioner PIN.

# Practitioner PIN

The Practitioner PIN method allows you to authorize your tax practitioner to enter or generate your PIN. Your electronic return is considered a validly signed return only when it includes your PIN, last name, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're filing jointly, your electronic return must also include your spouse's PIN, last name, date of birth, and IP PIN, if applicable, in order to be considered validly signed. The practitioner can provide you with details.

# Form 8453

You must send in a paper Form 8453 if you have to attach certain forms or other documents that can't be electronically filed. See Form 8453.

# Identity Protection PIN

All taxpayers are now eligible for an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN). For more information, see Pub. 5477. To apply for an IP PIN, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN and use the Get an IP PIN tool.

If you received an IP PIN from the IRS, enter it in the IP PIN spaces provided next to the space for your occupation. You must correctly enter all six numbers of your IP PIN. If you didn't receive an IP PIN, leave these spaces blank.

New IP PINs are generated every year. They will generally be sent out by mid-January 2025. Use this IP PIN on your 2024 return as well as any prior-year returns you file in 2025.

If you are filing a joint return and both taxpayers receive an IP PIN, enter both IP PINs in the spaces provided.
---
If you need more information, including how to retrieve your IP PIN online, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN. If you’re unable to retrieve your IP PIN online, you can call 800-908-4490.

# Phone Number and Email Address

You have the option of entering your phone number and email address in the spaces provided. There will be no effect on the processing of your return if you choose not to enter this information. Note that the IRS initiates most contacts through regular mail delivered by the United States Postal Service.

# Paid Preparer Must Sign Your Return

Generally, anyone you pay to prepare your return must sign it and include their Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) in the space provided. The preparer must give you a copy of the return for your records. Someone who prepares your return but doesn't charge you shouldn’t sign your return. If your paid preparer is self-employed, then they should check the “self-employed” checkbox.

# Assemble Your Return

Assemble any schedules and forms behind Form 1040 or 1040-SR in order of the “Attachment Sequence No.” shown in the upper-right corner of the schedule or form. If you have supporting statements, arrange them in the same order as the schedules or forms they support and attach them last. File your return, schedules, and other attachments on standard size paper. Cutting the paper may cause problems in processing your return. Don’t attach correspondence or other items unless required to do so. Attach Forms W-2 and 2439 to Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you received a Form W-2c (a corrected Form W-2), attach your original Forms W-2 and any Forms W-2c. Attach Forms W-2G and 1099-R to Form 1040 or 1040-SR if tax was withheld.

For information on how to report phone scams or unsolicited emails claiming to be from the IRS, see Secure Your Tax Records From Identity Theft, later.

# 2024 Tax Table

See the instructions for line 16 to see if you must use the Tax Table below to figure your tax.

CAUTION

Example. A married couple is filing a joint return. Their taxable income on Form 1040, line 15, is $25,300. First, they find the $25,300-25,350 taxable income line. Next, they find the column for married filing jointly and read down the column. The amount shown where the taxable income line and filing status column meet is $2,575. This is the tax amount they should enter in the entry space on Form 1040, line 16.

# General Information

The IRS Mission. Provide America's taxpayers top-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all.

# Voter Registration

Do you need to check or update your voter registration? Visit Vote.gov to confirm with your state election office.

# How To Avoid Common Mistakes

Mistakes can delay your refund or result in notices being sent to you. One of the best ways to file an accurate return is to file electronically. Tax software does the math for you and will help you avoid mistakes. Direct File and Free File provide eligible taxpayers the ability to file their taxes electronically for free. See IRS.gov/DirectFile and IRS.gov/FreeFile for details and to see if you are eligible.

- File your return on a standard size sheet of paper. Cutting the paper may cause problems in processing your return.
- Make sure you entered the correct name and social security number (SSN) for each dependent you claim in the Dependents section. Check that each dependent's name and SSN agrees with the dependent’s social security card. For each child under age 17 who is a qualifying child for the child tax credit or each dependent who qualifies you for the credit for other dependents, make sure you checked the appropriate box in column (4) of the Dependents section.
- Check your math, especially for the child tax credit, earned income credit (EIC), taxable social security benefits, total income, itemized deductions or standard deduction, taxable income, total tax, federal income tax withheld, and refund or amount you owe.
- Be sure you used the correct method to figure your tax. See the instructions for line 16.
- Be sure to enter your SSN in the space provided on page 1 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you are married filing a joint or separate return, also enter your spouse's SSN. Be sure to enter your SSN in the space next to your name. Check that your name and SSN agree with your social security card.
- If you owe tax and are paying by check or money order, be sure to include all the required information on your payment. See the instructions for line 37 for details.
- Make sure to check Where Do You File? before mailing your return. Over the next several years, the IRS will be reducing the number of paper tax return processing sites. Because of this, you may need to mail your return to a different address than you have in the past.
- Don’t file more than one original return for the same year, even if you haven't gotten your refund or haven't heard from the IRS since you filed. Filing more than one original return for the same year, or sending in more than one copy of the same return (unless we ask you to do so), could delay your refund.

# Innocent Spouse Relief

Generally, both you and your spouse are each responsible for paying the full amount of tax, interest, and penalties on your joint return. However, you may qualify for relief from liability for tax on a joint return if (a) there is an under-statement of tax because your spouse omitted income or claimed false deductions or credits; (b) you are divorced, separated, or no longer living with your spouse; or (c) given all the facts and circumstances, it wouldn't be fair to hold you liable for the tax. You may also qualify for relief if you were a married resident of a community property state but didn't file a joint return and are now liable for an unpaid or understated tax. File Form 8857 to request relief. In some cases, Form 8857 may need to be filed within 2 years of the date on which the IRS first attempted to collect the tax from you. Don’t file Form 8857 with your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. For more information, see Pub. 971 and Form 8857, or you can call the Innocent Spouse office toll free at 855-851-2009.

# Income Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax Payments for 2025

If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you are a victim of tax-related identity theft, visit IRS.gov/IdentityTheft to learn what steps you should take.

People who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability and who have access to TTY/TDD equipment can call (877-438-4338). Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a systemic problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that haven't been resolved through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the National Taxpayer Advocate helpline at 877-777-4778. People who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability and who have access to TTY/TDD equipment can call 800-829-4059. Deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals can also contact the IRS through Telecommunications Relay Services at FCC.gov/TRS.

Protect yourself from suspicious emails, texts, and social media messages, phishing schemes, and phone scams. Phishing is the creation and use of emails, texts, social media messages, and websites designed to mimic legitimate business communication and websites. The most common form is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.

The IRS doesn't initiate contact with or request detailed personal information from taxpayers via emails, texts, or social media messages. Also, the IRS doesn't ask taxpayers for the PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.

If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward the message to phishing@irs.gov. For more information, go to IRS.gov/Phishing.

# How Do You Make a Gift to Reduce Debt Held By the Public?

You can make a contribution by credit card, debit card, PayPal, checking account, or savings account. If you prefer, you can make a check payable to the “Bureau of the Fiscal Service” and send it to: Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Attn: Department G, P.O. Box 2188, Parkersburg, WV 26106-2188. Or you can enclose the check with your income tax return when you file. In the memo section of the check, make a note that it is a gift to reduce the debt held by the public. Don’t add your gift to any tax you may owe. See the instructions for line 37 for details on how to pay any tax you owe. For information on how to make this type of gift online, go to TreasuryDirect.gov/Help-Center/Public-Debt-FAQs/#DebtFinance and click on “How do you make a contribution to reduce the debt?”

You may be able to deduct this gift on your 2025 tax return.

# How Long Should Records Be Kept?

Keep a copy of your tax return, worksheets you used, and records of all items appearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and 1099) until the statute of limitations runs out for that return. Usually, this is 3 years from the date the return was due or filed or 2 years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later.
---
keep some records longer. For example, return to the address that applies to you online federal tax preparation, e-filing, keep property records (including those on your home) as long as they are needed to figure the basis of the original or replacement property. For more details, see chapter 1 of Pub. 17.

# Amended Return

File Form 1040-X to change a return you already filed. Generally, to timely claim a refund on your amended return, Form 1040-X must be filed within 3 years after the date the original return was filed or within 2 years after the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. But you may have more time to file Form 1040-X if you live in a federally declared disaster area or you are physically or mentally unable to manage your financial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details.

You can file Form 1040-X electronically with tax filing software to amend Forms 1040 and 1040-SR. See IRS.gov/Filing/Amended-Return-Frequently-Asked-Questions for more information.

Use the Where's My Amended Return application on IRS.gov to track the status of your amended return. It can take up to 3 weeks from the date you mailed it to show up in our system.

# Need a Copy of Your Tax Return Information?

Tax return transcripts are free and are generally used to validate income and tax filing status for mortgage applications, student and small business loan applications, and during tax return preparation. To get a free transcript:

- Access your online account at IRS.gov/Account,
- Visit IRS.gov/Transcript,
- Use Form 4506-T or 4506T-EZ, or

# Need someone to prepare your tax return?

There are various types of tax return preparers, including enrolled agents, certified public accountants (CPAs), accountants, and many others who don’t have professional credentials. If you choose to have someone prepare your tax return, choose that preparer wisely. A paid tax preparer is:

- Primarily responsible for the overall substantive accuracy of your return,
- Required to sign the return, and
- Required to include their preparer tax identification number (PTIN).

Although the tax preparer always signs the return, you're ultimately responsible for providing all the information required for the preparer to accurately prepare your return and for the accuracy of every item reported on the return. Anyone paid to prepare tax returns for others should have a thorough understanding of tax matters. For more information on how to choose a tax preparer, go to Tips for Choosing a Tax Preparer on IRS.gov.

# Interest and Penalties

You don’t have to figure the amount of any interest or penalties you may owe. We will send you a bill for any amount due.

# Interest

We will charge you interest on taxes not paid by their due date, even if an extension of time to file is granted. We will also charge you interest on penalties imposed for failure to file, negligence, fraud, substantial or gross valuation misstatements, substantial understatements of tax, and reportable transaction understatements. Interest is charged on the penalty from the due date of the return (including extensions).

# Penalties

In addition to any other penalties, the law imposes a penalty of $5,000 for filing a frivolous return. A frivolous return is one that doesn't contain information needed to figure the correct tax or shows a substantially incorrect tax because you take a frivolous position or desire to delay or interfere with the tax laws. This includes altering or striking out the preprinted language above the space where you sign. For a list of positions identified as frivolous, see Notice 2010-33, 2010-17 I.R.B. 609, available at IRS.gov/irb/2010-17_IRB#NOT-2010-33.

# Late filing

If you don’t file your return by the due date (including extensions), the penalty is usually 5% of the amount due for each month or part of a month your return is late, unless you have a reasonable explanation. If you have a reasonable explanation for filing late, include it with your return. The penalty can be as much as 25% of the tax due. The penalty is 15% per month, up to a maximum of 75%, if the failure to file is fraudulent. If your return is more than 60 days late, the minimum penalty will be $510 or the amount of any tax you owe, whichever is smaller.

# Late payment of tax

If you pay your taxes late, the penalty is usually ½ of 1% of the unpaid amount for each month or part of a month the tax isn't paid. The penalty can be as much as 25% of the unpaid amount. It applies to any unpaid tax on the return. This penalty is in addition to interest charges on late payments.

If you choose to include interest or penalties (other than the estimated tax penalty) with your payment, identify and enter the amount in the bottom margin of Form 1040 or 1040-SR, page 2. Don’t include interest or penalties (other than the estimated tax penalty) in the amount you owe on line 37. For more information on the estimated tax penalty, see Line 38, earlier.

Other penalties can be imposed for, among other things, negligence, substantial understatement of tax, reportable transaction understatements, filing an erroneous refund claim, and fraud. Criminal penalties may be imposed for willful failure to file, tax evasion, making a false statement, or identity theft. See Pub. 17 for details on some of these penalties.

# Refund Information

To check the status of your refund, go to IRS.gov/Refunds or use the free IRS2Go app, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Information about your refund will generally be available within 24 hours after the IRS receives your e-filed return or 4 weeks after you mail a paper return. But if you filed Form 8379 with your return, allow 14 weeks (11 weeks if you filed electronically) before checking your refund status.

The IRS can’t issue refunds before mid-February 2025 for returns that claim the earned income credit or the additional child tax credit. This delay applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits.

To use Where's My Refund, have a copy of your tax return handy. You will need to enter the following information from your return:

- Your social security number (or individual taxpayer identification number),
- The exact whole dollar amount of your refund,
- Your filing status.

Updates to refund status are made once a day—usually at night.

TIP: If you don’t have Internet access, you can call 800-829-1954, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for automated refund information. Our phone and walk-in assistants can research the status of your refund only if it's been 21 days or more since you filed electronically or more than 6 weeks since you mailed your paper return.

Don’t send in a copy of your return unless asked to do so.

To get a refund, you must generally file your return within 3 years from the date the return was due (including extensions).

Where's My Refund doesn't track refunds that are claimed on an amended tax return.

# Instructions for Schedule 1

# Additional Income and Adjustments to Income

# General Instructions

Use Schedule 1 to report income or adjustments to income that can’t be entered directly on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

Additional income is entered on Schedule 1, Part I. The amount on line 10 of Schedule 1 is entered on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 8.

Adjustments to income are entered on Schedule 1, Part II. The amount on line 26 is entered on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 10.

# Form(s) 1099-K

If, for tax year 2024, you received a Form(s) 1099-K that shows payments that were included in error (for example, money for gifts or reimbursements) or for personal items that you sold at a loss (for example, an old refrigerator), enter the amount that was included in error or for personal items sold at a loss in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1.

• If the entire amount reported to you on Form(s) 1099-K was in error or for personal items sold at a loss, enter the total amount from Form(s) 1099-K, box 1(a), in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1.

• If only some of the amount reported to you on Form(s) 1099-K in box 1(a) was in error or for personal items sold at a loss, only enter the amount that was in error or for personal items sold at a loss in the entry space at the top of Schedule 1. The remaining amounts reported to you on Form(s) 1099-K should be reported elsewhere on your return depending on the nature of the transactions.

# Additional Income

Line 1: Taxable Refunds, Credits, or Offsets of State and Local Income Taxes

None of your refund is taxable if, in the year you paid the tax, you either (a) didn't itemize deductions, or (b) elected to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes.

If you received a refund, credit, or offset of state or local income taxes in 2024, you may be required to report this amount. If you didn't receive a Form 1099-G, check with the government agency that made the payments to you.

Your 2024 Form 1099-G may have been made available to you only in an electronic format, and you will need to get instructions from the agency to retrieve this document. Report any taxable refund you received even if you didn't receive Form 1099-G.

If you chose to apply part or all of the refund to your 2024 estimated state or local income tax, the amount applied is treated as received in 2024. If the refund was for a tax you paid in 2023 and you incorrectly deducted state and local income taxes on your 2023 Schedule A, use the State and Local Income Tax Refund Worksheet in these instructions to see if any of your refund is taxable.

# Exception

See Itemized Deduction Recoveries in Pub. 525 instead of using the State and Local Income Tax Refund Worksheet in these instructions if any of the following applies:

1. You received a refund in 2024 that is for a tax year other than 2023.
2. You received a refund other than an income tax refund, such as a general sales tax or real property tax refund, in 2024 of an amount deducted or credit claimed in an earlier year.
---
# 3. You had taxable income on your compensation that you included in gross income in an earlier year, see Repay- ments in Pub. 525 for details on how to report the payment.

On line 2b, enter the month and year of your original divorce or separation agreement that relates to the alimony payment, if any, reported on line 2a.

# 4. Your 2023 state and local income tax refund is more than your 2023 state and local income tax deduction minus the amount you could have deducted as your 2023 state and local general sales taxes.

If you have alimony payments from more than one divorce or separation agreement, on line 2b enter the month and year of the divorce or separation agreement for which you received the most income. Attach a statement listing the month and year of the other agreements.

# 5. You made your last payment of 2023 estimated state or local income tax in 2024.

# 6. You owed alternative minimum tax in 2023.

# 7. You couldn't use the full amount of credits you were entitled to in 2023 because the total credits were more than the amount shown on your 2023 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 16.

# 8. You could be claimed as a dependent by someone else in 2023.

# 9. You received a refund because of a jointly filed state or local income tax return, but you aren't filing a joint 2024 Form 1040 or 1040-SR with the same person.

# Lines 2a and 2b

# Alimony Received

You should receive a Form 1099-G showing in box 1 the total unemployment compensation paid to you in 2024. Report this amount on line 7.

# Line 2a

Enter amounts received as alimony or separate maintenance pursuant to a divorce or separation agreement entered into on or before December 31, 2018, unless that agreement was changed after December 31, 2018, to expressly provide that alimony received isn't included in your income. Alimony received is not included in your income if you entered into a divorce or separation agreement after December 31, 2018. If you are including alimony in your income, you must let the person who made the payments know your social security number. If you don’t, you may have to pay a penalty. For more details, see Pub. 504.

If you are including alimony payments from more than one divorce or separation agreement in your income, enter the total of all alimony received on line 2a.

# Line 3

Business Income or (Loss)

If you operated a business or practiced your profession as a sole proprietor, report your income and expenses on Schedule C.

# Line 4

If you sold or exchanged assets used in a trade or business, see the Instructions for Form 4797.

# Line 8m

Olympic and Paralympic medals and USOC prize money. The value of Olympic and Paralympic medals and the amount of United States Olympic Committee (USOC) prize money you receive on account of your participation in the Olympic or Paralympic Games may be nontaxable. These amounts should be reported to you in box 3 of Form 1099-MISC. To see if these amounts are nontaxable, first figure your adjusted gross income, including the amount of your medals and prize money. If your adjusted gross income is not more than $1,000,000 ($500,000 if married filing separately), these amounts are nontaxable and you should include the amount in box 3 of Form 1099-MISC on line 8m, then subtract it by including it on line 24c.

If nontaxable payments were reported to you in box 1 of Form(s) W-2, report the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a. If you did not receive a Form W-2 for nontaxable payments, or you received nontaxable payments that you didn’t report on line 1a, and choose to include nontaxable amounts in earned income for purposes of claiming a credit or other tax benefit, report the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1d. Then, on line 8s enter the total amount of the nontaxable payments reported on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a or 1d, in the entry space in the preprinted parentheses (as a negative number). For more information about these payments, see Pub. 525.

# Adjustments to Income

Any reimbursements you received for these expenses that weren’t reported to you in box 1 of your Form W-2.

# Self-Employed SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans

If you were self-employed or a partner, you may be able to take this deduction. See Pub. 560 or, if you were a minister, Pub. 517.

# Educator Expenses

If you were an eligible educator in 2024, you can deduct on line 11 up to $300 of qualified expenses you paid in 2024. If you and your spouse are filing jointly and both of you were eligible educators, the maximum deduction is $600. However, neither spouse can deduct more than $300 of their qualified expenses on line 11. An eligible educator is a kindergarten through grade 12 teacher, instructor, counselor, principal, or aide who worked in a school for at least 900 hours during a school year.

Qualified expenses include ordinary and necessary expenses paid:

- For professional development courses you have taken related to the curriculum you teach or to the students you teach; or
- In connection with books, supplies, equipment (including computer equipment, software, and services), and other materials used in the classroom.

An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your educational field. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your profession as an educator. An expense doesn’t have to be required to be considered necessary.

TIP: Qualified expenses include amounts paid or incurred in 2024 for personal protective equipment, disinfectant, and other supplies used for the prevention of the spread of coronavirus.

Qualified expenses don’t include expenses for home schooling or for non-athletic supplies for courses in health or physical education.

You must reduce your qualified expenses by the following amounts:

- Excludable U.S. series EE and I savings bond interest from Form 8815.
- Nontaxable qualified tuition program earnings or distributions.
- Any nontaxable distribution of Coverdell education savings account earnings.

# Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction

You may be able to deduct the amount you paid for health insurance (which includes medical, dental, and vision insurance and qualified long-term care insurance) for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents. The insurance can also cover your child who was under age 27 at the end of 2024, even if the child wasn't your dependent. A child includes your son, daughter, stepchild, adopted child, or foster child (defined in Who Qualifies as Your Dependent in the Instructions for Form 1040).

One of the following statements must be true:

- You were self-employed and had a profit for the year reported on Schedule C or F.
- You were a partner with net earnings from self-employment.
- You used one of the optional methods to figure your net earnings from self-employment on Schedule SE.
- You received wages in 2024 from an S corporation in which you were a more-than-2% shareholder. Health insurance premiums paid or reimbursed by the S corporation are shown as wages on Form W-2.

The insurance plan must be established under your business. Your personal services must have been a material income-producing factor in the business. If you are filing Schedule C or F, the policy can be either in your name or in the name of the business. If you are a partner, the policy can be either in your name or in the name of the partnership. You can either pay the premiums yourself or your partnership can pay them and report them as guaranteed payments. If the policy is in your name and you pay the premiums yourself, the partnership must reimburse you and report the premiums as guaranteed payments.

# Moving Expenses

You can deduct moving expenses if you are a member of the Armed Forces on active duty and due to a military order you move because of a permanent change of station. Use Tax Topic 455 or see Form 3903.

# Deductible Part of Self-Employment Tax

If you were self-employed and owe self-employment tax, fill in Schedule SE to figure the amount of your deduction. The deductible part of your self-employment tax is on line 13 of Schedule SE.

you made to or for your spouse if you deduction. But read the following list before you fill in the worksheet.

1. You can't deduct contributions to a Roth IRA. But you may be able to take the retirement savings contributions credit (saver's credit). See the instructions for Schedule 3, line 4.
2. If you are filing a joint return and you or your spouse made contributions to both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA for 2024, don’t use the IRA Deduction Worksheet in these instructions. Instead, see Pub. 590-A to figure the amount, if any, of your IRA deduction.
3. You can’t deduct elective deferrals to a 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, section 457 plan, SIMPLE IRA plan, or the federal Thrift Savings Plan. These amounts aren't included as income in box 1 of your Form W-2.
4. If you made contributions to your IRA in 2024 that you deducted for 2023, don’t include them in the worksheet.
5. If you received income from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or nongovernmental section 457 plan that is included in box 1 of your Form W-2, or in box 1 of Form 1099-NEC, don’t include that income on line 8 of the worksheet. The income should be shown in (a) box 11 of your Form W-2, (b) box 12 of your Form W-2 with code Z, or (c) box 15 of Form 1099-MISC. If it isn't, contact your employer or the payer for the amount of the income.
6. You must file a joint return to deduct contributions to your spouse's IRA. Enter the total IRA deduction for you and your spouse on line 20.
7. Don’t include rollover contributions in figuring your deduction. Instead, see the instructions for Form 1040 or 1040-SR, lines 4a and 4b.
8. Don't include trustees' fees that were billed separately and paid by you for your IRA.
9. Don’t include any repayments of qualified reservist distributions. You can't deduct them. For information on how to report these repayments, see Qualified reservist repayments in Pub. 590-A.
10. If the total of your IRA deduction on line 20 plus any nondeductible contribution to your traditional IRAs shown on Form 8606 is less than your total traditional IRA contributions for 2024, see Pub. 590-A for special rules.

# Were You Covered by a Retirement Plan?

If you were covered by a retirement plan (qualified pension, profit-sharing (including 401(k)), annuity, SEP, SIMPLE, etc.) at work or through self-employment, your IRA deduction may be reduced or eliminated. But you can still make contributions to an IRA even if you can't deduct them. In any case, the income earned on your IRA contributions isn't taxed until it is paid to you.

The “Retirement plan” box in box 13 of your Form W-2 should be checked if you were covered by a plan at work even if you weren’t vested in the plan. You are also covered by a plan if you were self-employed and had a SEP, SIMPLE, or qualified retirement plan.

If you were covered by a retirement plan and you file Form 2555 or 8815, or you exclude employer-provided adoption benefits, see Pub. 590-A to figure the amount, if any, of your IRA deduction.

Married persons filing separately. If you weren’t covered by a retirement plan but your spouse was, you are considered covered by a plan unless you lived apart from your spouse for all of 2024.

You may be able to take the retirement savings contributions credit. See the Schedule 3, line 4, instructions.

If you, or your spouse if filing a joint return, had more than one employer for 2024 and total wages of more than $168,600, too much social security or tier 1 railroad retirement (RRTA) tax may have been withheld. You can take a credit on this line for the amount withheld in excess of $10,453.20. But if any one employer withheld more than $10,453.20, you can't claim the excess on your return. The employer should adjust the tax for you. If the employer doesn't adjust the overcollection, you can file a claim for refund using Form 843.

# Line 13

Lines 13a Through 13z

Other Payments or Refundable Credits

# Line 13b

If you are claiming a credit for repayment of amounts you included in your income in an earlier year because it appeared you had a right to the income, enter the amount on line 13b. See Pub. 525 for details about this credit.

# Line 13c

Enter any net elective payment election amount from Form 3800, Part III, line 6, column (j).

# Line 13d

If you elected to pay your net 965 tax liability in installments, report the deferred amount on line 13d. Enter the amount of net 965 tax liability remaining to be paid in future years.

# Line 13z

Other refundable credits. Use line 13z to report the credit under section 960(c) with respect to an excess limitation account. If an increase in the limitation under section 960(c) is more than your U.S. income tax reported on Form 1116, Part III, line 20, the amount of the excess is deemed an overpayment of tax and can be claimed on line 13z as a refundable credit. See section 960(c)(5).

Also use line 13z to report the amount of U.S. tax allocable to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Enter “Form 8689” and the amount paid.

# Disclosure, Privacy Act, and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice

The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 require that when we ask you for information we must first tell you our legal right to ask for the information, why we are asking for it, and how it will be used. We must also tell you what could happen if we do not receive it and whether your response is voluntary, required to obtain a benefit, or mandatory under the law.

This notice applies to all records and other material (in paper or electronic format) you file with us, including this tax return. It also applies to any questions we need to ask you so we can complete, correct, or process your return; figure your tax; and collect tax, interest, or penalties.

Our legal right to ask for information is Internal Revenue Code sections 6001, 6011, and 6012(a), and their regulations. They say that you must file a return or statement with us for any tax you are liable for. Your response is mandatory under these sections. Code section 6109 requires you to provide your identifying number on the return. This is so we know who you are, and can process your return and other papers. You must fill in all parts of the tax form that apply to you. But you do not have to check the boxes for the Presidential Election Campaign Fund or for the third-party designee. You also do not have to provide your daytime phone number or email address.

You are not required to provide the information requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB control number. Books or records relating to a form or its instructions must be retained as long as their contents may become material in the administration of any Internal Revenue law.

We ask for tax return information to carry out the tax laws of the United States. We need it to figure and collect the right amount of tax.

If you do not file a return, do not provide the information we ask for, or provide fraudulent information, you may be charged penalties and be subject to criminal prosecution. We may also have to disallow the exemptions, exclusions, credits, deductions, or adjustments shown on the tax return. This could make the tax higher.

# Estimates of Taxpayer Burden

The following table shows burden estimates based on current statutory requirements as of December 1, 2024, for taxpayers filing a 2024 Form 1040 or 1040-SR tax return. Time spent and out-of-pocket costs are presented separately. Time burden is broken out by taxpayer activity, with recordkeeping representing the largest component. Out-of-pocket costs include any expenses incurred by taxpayers to prepare and submit their tax returns. Examples include tax return preparation and submission fees, postage and photocopying costs, and tax return preparation software costs.

|Taxpayer Activity|Average Time Burden (Hours)|Average Cost ($)|
|---|---|---|
|All Taxpayers|13|290|
|Nonbusiness Taxpayers|8|160|
|Business Taxpayers|24|620|

Reported time and cost burdens are national averages and don’t necessarily reflect a “typical” case. Most taxpayers experience lower than average burden, with taxpayer burden varying considerably by taxpayer type. Within this estimate, there is significant variation in taxpayer activity. Similarly, tax return preparation fees and other out-of-pocket costs vary extensively depending on the complexity of the tax situation.

# We Welcome Comments on Forms

We try to create forms and instructions that can be easily understood. Often this is difficult to do because our tax laws are very complex. For some people with income mostly from wages, filling in the forms is easy. For others who have businesses, pensions, stocks, rental income, or other investments, it is more difficult.

If you have suggestions for making these forms simpler, we would be happy to hear from you. You can send us comments through IRS.gov/FormsComments.

# Major Categories of Federal Income and Outlays for Fiscal Year 2023

Income and Outlays. These pie charts show the relative sizes of the major categories of federal income and outlays for fiscal year 2023.

|Income|Outlays*|
|---|---|
|Social security, Medicare, and unemployment and other retirement taxes|Social security, Medicare, and other retirement1|
|35%|39%|
|Personal income taxes|National defense, veterans, and foreign affairs2|
|26%|23%|
|Corporate income taxes|Social programs4|
|7%|19%|
|Excise, customs, estate, gift, and miscellaneous taxes| |
|4%| |
|Borrowing to cover deficit| |
|28%| |
| |Physical, human, and community development3|
| |11%|
| |2%|
| |7%|

*Numbers may not total to 100% due to rounding.

On or before the first Monday in February 30, 2023, federal income was $4.441 trillion and outlays were $6.135 trillion, leaving a deficit of $1.694 trillion.

The budget plan sets forth the President's proposed receipts, spending, and the surplus or deficit for the federal government. The plan includes recommendations for new legislation as well as recommendations to change, eliminate, and add programs.

After receipt of the President's proposal, the Congress reviews the proposal and makes changes. It first passes a budget resolution setting its own targets for receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit. Next, individual spending and revenue bills that are consistent with the goals of the budget resolution are enacted.

In fiscal year 2023 (which began on October 1, 2022, and ended on September 30, 2023).

# Footnotes for Certain Federal Outlays

1. Social security, Medicare, and other retirement: These programs provide income support for the retired and disabled and medical care for the elderly.
2. National defense, veterans, and foreign affairs: About 13% of outlays were to equip, modernize, and pay our armed forces and to fund national defense activities; about 5% were for veterans benefits and services; and about 1% were for international activities, including military and economic assistance to foreign countries and the maintenance of U.S. embassies abroad.
3. Physical, human, and community development: These outlays were for agriculture; natural resources; environment; transportation; aid for elementary and secondary education and direct assistance to college students; job training; deposit insurance, commerce and housing credit, and community development; and space, energy, and general science programs.
4. Social programs: About 17% of total outlays were for Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps), temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income, and related programs; and 6% for health research and public health programs, unemployment compensation, assisted housing, and social services.

Note. The percentages shown here exclude undistributed offsetting receipts, which were $132 billion in fiscal year 2023. In the budget, these receipts are offset against spending in figuring the outlay totals shown above. These receipts are for the U.S. Government's share of its employee retirement programs, rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf, and proceeds from the sale of assets.

# Your Rights as a Taxpayer

# The Taxpayer Bill of Rights

1. # The Right to Be Informed

Taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. They have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.
2. # The Right to Quality Service

Taxpayers have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service.
3. # The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax

Taxpayers have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due, including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly.
4. # The Right to Challenge the IRS’s Position and Be Heard

Taxpayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position.
5. # The Right to Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum

Taxpayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the IRS Independent Office of Appeals’ decision. Taxpayers generally have the right to take their cases to court.
6. # The Right to Finality

Taxpayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS’s position as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxpayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit.
7. # The Right to Privacy

Taxpayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law and be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure protections, and will provide, where applicable, a collection due process hearing.
8. # The Right to Confidentiality

Taxpayers have the right to expect that any information they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law. Taxpayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information.
9. # The Right to Retain Representation

Taxpayers have the right to retain the representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxpayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low Income Taxpayer Clinic if they cannot afford representation.
10. # The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System

Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely. Taxpayers have the right to receive assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate Service if they are experiencing financial difficulty or if the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and timely through its normal channels.
